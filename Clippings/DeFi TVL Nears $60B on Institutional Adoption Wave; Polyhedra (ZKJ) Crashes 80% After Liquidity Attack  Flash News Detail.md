## DeFi TVL Nears $60B on Institutional Adoption Wave; Polyhedra (ZKJ) Crashes 80% After Liquidity Attack

![DeFi TVL Nears $60B on Institutional Adoption Wave; Polyhedra (ZKJ) Crashes 80% After Liquidity Attack](https://image.blockchain.news/features/DC3788979712BF4DFF603597AAC46E7C52F8B5EF76BC21453D757F37CDB271FE.jpg)

According to @KookCapitalLLC, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is experiencing a significant transformation, with total value locked (TVL) in top lending protocols like Aave and Morpho surging 60% over the past year to nearly $60 billion. A report from analytics firm Artemis and Vaults.fyi attributes this growth to increasing institutional participation and the integration of DeFi as a backend layer for user-facing apps, a trend known as the "DeFi mullet". For instance, Coinbase's integration with Morpho has originated over $300 million in Bitcoin (BTC) backed loans. The report also highlights the rise of on-chain asset managers, whose capital under management has quadrupled from $1 billion to over $4 billion since January, and the growing use of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). In specific market events, the Polyhedra protocol's ZKJ token plummeted over 80% following what the team described as a coordinated liquidity attack on PancakeSwap. The Polyhedra team responded by injecting approximately $30 million in USDT, USDC, and BNB to stabilize liquidity and announced an upcoming buyback plan. Other significant developments include JPMorgan piloting a permissioned USD deposit token (JPMD) on the Base network and the U.S. Senate passing a stablecoin bill with strong bipartisan support, signaling potential shifts in the regulatory landscape.

### Analysis

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is undergoing a significant maturation, shifting from speculative, high-yield frenzies to a more sustainable model driven by institutional adoption and sophisticated infrastructure. A recent report from analytics firm Artemis and on-chain yield platform Vaults.fyi highlights this evolution, revealing that the total value locked (TVL) in top DeFi lending protocols has surged past $50 billion, a remarkable 60% increase over the past year. Protocols such as Aave (AAVE), Euler, Spark, and Morpho are at the forefront of this growth, transforming from simple yield platforms into complex, modular financial networks. This institutionalization is not just about capital inflow; it's about the integration of robust risk management and the increasing use of DeFi as a backend financial layer for mainstream applications.

  
  

## The 'DeFi Mullet' and Institutional Integration

  

A key driver of this new wave is a trend dubbed the "DeFi mullet": a fintech front-end powered by a DeFi back-end. This model abstracts the complexities of blockchain away from the end-user, creating seamless financial experiences. A prime example is Coinbase's partnership with DeFi lender Morpho, which allows users to borrow against their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. This integration has already originated over $300 million in loans, demonstrating strong product-market fit. Similarly, Bitget Walletâ€™s integration with Aave offers a stable 5% yield on USDC and USDT directly within the wallet. This trend is even influencing traditional finance, with giants like PayPal offering yield on its PYUSD stablecoin. The report suggests that crypto-friendly fintechs like Robinhood could be next, potentially creating new revenue streams by offering stablecoin credit lines and asset-backed loans powered by DeFi markets. This fusion of TradFi user bases with DeFi efficiency presents a massive growth vector for the entire ecosystem and a long-term bullish signal for assets like AAVE and ETH, which underpins much of this activity.

  
  

## Polyhedra (ZKJ) in Crisis After Liquidity Attack

  

While the broader DeFi sector shows signs of maturity, acute risks remain, as evidenced by the recent crisis surrounding Polyhedra's ZKJ token. The token's price plummeted over 80% in a matter of minutes following what the team described as a coordinated liquidity attack. According to a post-mortem analysis released by the project, the event was triggered by attacks on the ZKJ/KOGE pool on PancakeSwap. On-chain data, as analyzed by reporter Shaurya Malwa, revealed that several addresses drained millions from the pool, with one wallet alone removing approximately $4.3 million in liquidity provider (LP) tokens before dumping 1.57 million ZKJ. This sell-off cascaded from the shallow KOGE/USDT pool to the deeper ZKJ/USDT pool, creating a death spiral. In response, the Polyhedra team injected around $30 million in USDT, USDC, and BNB to stabilize decentralized exchange liquidity and announced a buyback plan to restore confidence. This incident serves as a stark reminder for traders about the inherent risks of shallow liquidity pools and the potential for sophisticated attacks, creating extreme volatility and short-term trading opportunities for those monitoring on-chain data closely.

  
  

### Market Developments and On-Chain Asset Management

  

Beyond specific protocol events, the market continues to see innovation. The INK Foundation is set to airdrop its INK token to bootstrap its Layer-2 capital markets, a strategy designed to build liquidity from day one on its Aave-powered protocol. Meanwhile, U.S. banking giant JPMorgan is piloting a permissioned USD deposit token, JPMD, on Base, Coinbase's Layer-2 network, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. This institutional move into tokenization on public blockchains like Base could drive significant volume and validation for the Ethereum ecosystem. Another critical, albeit less visible, trend is the rise of on-chain asset managers like Gauntlet and Steakhouse Financial. These firms now manage over $4 billion, a fourfold increase since January, according to the Artemis report. They operate like traditional asset managers, allocating capital, managing risk parameters for protocols, and deploying funds across structured products and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Their growing influence signifies a new level of professionalism and capital allocation efficiency entering the DeFi space, which could lead to more stable and predictable yields over the long term.
