## TLDR

- Dinari becomes first to offer legal tokenized stocks in the U.S., gaining a key regulatory edge.
- Tokenized equities hit Wall Street: Dinari secures broker-dealer license for U.S. rollout.
- Dinari’s SEC-backed tokenized stock model sets new precedent for blockchain finance.
- 24/7 stock trading gets real: Dinari wins U.S. approval for blockchain-based equities.
- Dinari leapfrogs rivals with legal U.S. tokenized equity launch — Coinbase and Kraken still waiting.

Dinari has gained U.S. regulatory approval to operate as a broker-dealer through its subsidiary, marking a pivotal milestone. This registration makes Dinari the first platform to legally offer tokenized equities directly to U.S. participants. The development signals a shift in the digital asset landscape as tokenized finance moves closer to mainstream financial infrastructure.

Dinari’s platform converts traditional U.S. company shares into digital tokens, enabling blockchain-based stock trading. These tokens mirror the value and ownership rights of actual securities but operate on decentralized networks. As a result, market participants can access around-the-clock trading and potentially lower fees.

This approval follows ongoing discussions between Dinari and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has stated its intention to begin operations in the next quarter. It will initially focus on embedding its services into other financial platforms rather than providing direct customer access.

## Dinari’s Regulatory Milestone Sets New Precedent

Dinari becomes the first to create a legally approved tokenized stock structure in the [United States](https://coincentral.com/okx-launches-crypto-exchange-and-wallet-in-the-united-states/). Unlike platforms limited to offshore users, Dinari’s approval enables blockchain-based equity access within U.S. borders. This structure represents a departure from conventional brokerages like Robinhood or Schwab.

Dinari has secured a green light under existing U.S. securities law. This allows it to move ahead of rivals such as Coinbase and Kraken, which still seek SEC authorization. Dinari also reports that it has several partnerships lined up, although names remain undisclosed.

The company has already released dShares, its tokenized equities, outside the U.S. on platforms like Base. However, due to regulatory restrictions, these offerings have excluded U.S.-based users. Now, Dinari can legally serve the U.S. market under its broker-dealer license.

## Tokenized Stock Model Offers Practical Benefits

Tokenized equities promise real-time settlement and 24/7 access, which traditional markets currently do not offer. These blockchain-based assets could also lower back-office costs and reduce counterparty risk. As adoption grows, such models may become standard for future financial systems.

Dinari aims to set the benchmark with a fully compliant model that aligns with current legal frameworks. [Blockchain](https://blockonomi.com/partisia-blockchain-guide/) eliminates intermediaries and speeds up trade execution. By integrating with existing platforms, Dinari avoids direct-to-consumer complexities while maintaining full functionality.

The firm’s approach emphasizes interoperability, allowing financial institutions to incorporate tokenized equities seamlessly. While others still experiment in sandbox environments, Dinari’s license gives it a functional market advantage. The next step involves expanding U.S. operations with compliant offerings.

## Key Industry Challenges Remain

The World Economic Forum has identified two major hurdles for [tokenized assets](https://moneycheck.com/coinbase-coin-stock-shares-rally-as-crypto-exchange-seeks-sec-approval-for-tokenized-stock-trading/). These include limited secondary-market liquidity and the absence of global regulatory standards. Without both, the full potential of tokenized equities remains partially unrealized.

Dinari operates within this evolving landscape, which lacks cross-border harmonization. Although the U.S. green light is a breakthrough, international usage still faces restrictions. This reality limits scalability for firms looking to offer universal access to digital securities.

## TLDR

- Michael Saylor led MicroStrategy’s $500 million shift from cash to Bitcoin.
- He described fiat currency as a melting asset that loses value over time.
- Gold was dismissed by Saylor due to its increasing supply and weakening returns.
- MicroStrategy rejected real estate, bonds, and stocks for long-term value storage.
- Saylor praised Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million coin supply as a critical strength.

MicroStrategy’s strategic shift into Bitcoin followed deep concerns about the long-term value of fiat currency and traditional assets. [Michael Saylor](https://coincentral.com/why-michael-saylor-thinks-your-bitcoin-could-be-worth-21-million-by-2046/), Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, described fiat as unreliable and gold as structurally flawed for preserving value. The company has since invested over $500 million in Bitcoin, treating it as a durable financial strategy.

## Michael Saylor Warns Cash Is Losing Value

Michael Saylor viewed the U.S. dollar as a rapidly depreciating asset amid rising inflation and diminishing purchasing power. He explained that holding cash yielded negative real returns, eroding corporate reserves and weakening long-term shareholder value. As inflation accelerated, MicroStrategy’s cash position appeared increasingly vulnerable, triggering a fundamental reassessment.

[Saylor likened cash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-4rYsuqBgY) to a melting asset that loses value monthly, undermining any long-term capital preservation strategy. This realization, combined with investor pressure for yield, forced him to seek viable alternatives. MicroStrategy found no traditional solution that could shield value against economic deterioration.

The company rejected cash retention after calculating a real yield loss of up to 25% during inflationary periods. Saylor emphasized that markets penalized cash-heavy firms while rewarding those allocating assets effectively. Consequently, MicroStrategy identified the need for a store of valuethat is resilient to currency devaluation.

## Gold and Equities Failed to Meet Preservation Needs

Michael Saylor examined several options before selecting [Bitcoin](https://coincentral.com/metaplanet-inc-mtplf-stock-dips-nearly-6-despite-bold-1234-bitcoin-acquisition-drive/), including gold, equities, bonds, and real estate. He dismissed gold due to its supply growth, explaining that rising prices incentivized more mining, weakening long-term returns. MicroStrategy determined that gold lacked the scarcity needed for true value storage.

Equities, though productive, involved unpredictable equity risks that Saylor considered unsuitable for capital preservation. Meanwhile, bonds offered subpar fixed returns that failed to keep pace with inflation-adjusted losses. Property holdings involved tax burdens and illiquidity, adding more complexity than benefit.

Saylor concluded that traditional asset classes lacked the fixed structure necessary for secure, long-term capital storage. He believed none could match Bitcoin’s capped supply and decentralized structure. As a result, MicroStrategy shifted its capital into what Saylor called a “steel vessel” built to endure.

## Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply and Network Design Drove the Move

Michael Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million coin supply as its most significant strength over other assets. He argued that scarcity ensures Bitcoin cannot be inflated through excess production, unlike commodities or currencies. [MicroStrategy](https://coincentral.com/microstrategy-mstr-stock-bitcoin-bets-pay-off-despite-q125-losses/) has seen this as critical for preserving value for decades.

The company approached its Bitcoin purchases methodically, using OTC brokers and automation to execute trades without disrupting market prices. Saylor waited for high-fear moments to make significant buys, focusing on long-term accumulation. This strategy allowed MicroStrategy to amass its position efficiently and securely.

He contrasted Bitcoin’s encrypted energy protection with Ethereum’s structure, preferring Bitcoin’s established consensus. Saylor stated that Bitcoin’s reliability made it the only logical choice for lasting value. MicroStrategy continues to support Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset.
