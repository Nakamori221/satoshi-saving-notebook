## White House Crypto Czar Confirms Timeline for Sweeping Digital Asset Reform

U.S. lawmakers are rapidly aligning on long-awaited digital asset regulation, setting the stage for crypto markets and stablecoins to gain federal legitimacy. White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks posted on social media platform X on June 26 that the Senate is preparing a comprehensive digital asset market structure framework.

He thanked Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Cynthia Lummis for “announcing a clear timeline and plan for comprehensive crypto market structure legislation.” The legislative sequence is firm: introduce the bill before the August recess, mark it up in the first week of September, and finalize it by the end of that month. In a follow-up post, Sacks highlighted what’s next:

> July will be a big month, with a bill signing for GENIUS, and CLARITY going to the Senate!

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act of 2025 has already [cleared the Senate](https://news.bitcoin.com/senate-passes-genius-stablecoin-act-sends-bill-to-house-for-consideration/). This bill establishes rules for issuing payment stablecoins. Only approved issuers, including subsidiaries of insured banks, federally qualified nonbanks, or state-qualified entities with stablecoin issuance of $10 billion or less, may offer them to U.S. users under federal or state regulation. Issuers must back coins one-to-one with U.S. currency or similar liquid assets, disclose redemption policies, and publish monthly reserve reports. It also regulates reserve use, safekeeping, and federal oversight.

Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act of 2025 was [introduced](https://news.bitcoin.com/landmark-crypto-legislation-introduced-in-congress-clarity-act-ushers-in-golden-age/) in the House to establish regulatory boundaries between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It establishes a legal framework for digital assets to reduce regulatory confusion that has pushed innovation offshore and increased consumer risk. The act defines agency roles, mandates broker disclosures and fund segregation, and provides legal avenues for developers to raise capital and trade crypto-based commodities. It emphasizes transparency, accountability, investor protection, and maintaining U.S. leadership in global digital asset markets.
