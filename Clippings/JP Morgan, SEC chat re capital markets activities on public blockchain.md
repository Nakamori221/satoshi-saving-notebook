The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posted a [memo](https://www.sec.gov/files/ctf-memo-jpmorgan-chase-co-061725.pdf) yesterday detailing a meeting between its Crypto Task Force and [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global). While the task force primarily handles cryptocurrency issues, it also oversees tokenization matters that increasingly affect traditional finance (TradFi) companies.

JP Morgan’s meeting agenda revealed three key discussion points: an overview of its existing digital finance services including repo solutions and debt platforms, analysis of how capital markets activity might migrate to public blockchains, and plans for future regulatory engagement.

The discussion likely centered heavily on [tokenized collateral](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/tokenized-collateral/), an area where multiple regulators are actively involved. The [CFTC](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/cftc-unveils-plans-for-tokenized-collateral-pilot/) is currently running tokenized collateral pilots for derivatives margin posting, and the [DTCC](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/dtcc-to-launch-tokenized-collateral-platform/) is launching its own platform. The [CME](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/cme-to-trial-tokenization-on-googles-new-universal-ledger-dlt/) is also participating in this space.

## Tokenized collateral addresses market risks

Traditional margin requirements involve initial margin at trade inception and variation margin over time. Securities typically serve as initial margin while cash covers variation margin due to settlement delays. This creates market risks during volatile periods when institutions must sell assets to generate cash.

Tokenization offers a solution by allowing institutions to transfer tokenized securities directly to meet margin requirements without selling underlying assets. JP Morgan’s recent announcement of [JPMD deposit tokens](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/jp-morgan-to-launch-jpmd-deposit-token-on-public-blockchain-base/) on the Base public blockchain further addresses cash collateral needs, providing an alternative to stablecoins.

The bank already operates a [tokenized collateral](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/jp-morgan-tokenized-collateral-network-tcn/) solution on its permissioned blockchain, Kinexys, alongside an [intraday repo](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/santander-cib-executes-intraday-repo-on-jp-morgan-blockchain-infrastructure/) solution called Digital Financing and a bond issuance platform called [Digital Debt Services](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/quincy-us-municipal-bond-issued-on-jp-morgans-onyx-blockchain/). However, using permissioned blockchains creates integration challenges that public blockchains can ease.

## Targeting traditional finance adoption

While [BlackRock](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/analysis-blackrock-buidl-update-shows-key-design-options-in-tokenized-money-market-funds/) and have tokenized money market funds on public blockchains, so far their usage has primarily attracted crypto institutions rather than traditional finance companies. sees an opportunity to serve the latter market.

The meeting was led by Scott Lucas, JP Morgan’s Head of Markets Digital Assets since early 2021, who serves on the boards of blockchain firms [Ownera](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/jp-morgan-part-of-20m-ownera-funding-for-security-token-interoperability/) (interoperability) and [HQLAᵡ](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/eurex-gets-bafin-approval-for-dlt-based-margin-collateral-via-hqla%E1%B5%A1-jp-morgan-to-go-first/) (digital collateral). He was joined by Justin Cohen, who oversees product development for the equity derivatives group that would potentially automate tokenized collateral posting for the bank’s own trading operations.
