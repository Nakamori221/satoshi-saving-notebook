**Crypto Neobank:-** In a first of its kind, the Ethereum Layer-2 network Mantle has debuted the first crypto Neobank on Wednesday. Named as UR, the Mantle-backed Neobank “runs entirely on blockchain.”

A crypto neobank combines the service set of a traditional neobank with the on‑ and off‑chain rails of crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi). In practice, it allows users to have a one unified Fiat + Crypto Accounts where they can hold, send, and receive fiat currencies alongside crypto assets. Thus, Mantle is calling its neobank UR as the significant step in bridging Defi and TradeFi.

## Mantle’s Crypto NeoBank – UR

Though there are several crypto‑friendly neobanks and banking apps today, fully on‑chain “neobanks” are still emerging. Mantle’s UR, pronounced as “You Are”, comes as a strong pioneer in the industry.

Mantle’s UR allows users to open Swiss IVAN accounts to begin spending or saving in their Crypto or fiat finances. The currencies it supports include EUR, CHF, USD, and RMB, backed 1:1 by tokenized deposits under a Swiss banking license. It currently makes fund transfers using SWIFT, SEPA, and Ethereum, however, in near future, it aims to shift to Base and Mantle NeTwork.

Besides providing spending or saving services, there are other expected services to be rolled out too. By 2025, UR will include foreign exchange, fiat-to-crypto on ramps, yielding and lending tools as well.

### From L2 Protocol to Banking Chain

Mantle’s UR is a blockchain‑native bank which implies that every account, card transaction, and future lending or yield strategy will live on the Mantle Layer‑2. According to the [official announcement](https://group.mantle.xyz/blog/announcements/mantle-launches-crypto-first-neobank-ur), it will soon evolve into a full‑fledged banking chain.

Thus, as a banking chain, Mantle will turn into a purpose‑built blockchain whose core protocol and modules are designed to handle traditional banking functions directly on‑chain, rather than as bolt‑on applications. Its current launch is open only to early contributors’ access, with full public access scheduled for Q3 2025.

### Crypto NeoBanks Have a Huge Rate of Success

Crypto‑friendly neobanks and banking apps today have crypto services just as “add-ons” and are not specifically built for them. For example, Revolut, a digital‑only challenger bank with integrated crypto trading. This is same for the European neobank N26 which has added a first‑party “Crypto” tab.

While “pure” on‑chain neobanks such as Mantle’s UR are just arriving, roughly 10 % of existing neobank customers actively use crypto features today. Leading player Revolut have added 15 million new customers in 2024 alone to reach 52.5 M total. According to Revolut’s full‑year 2024 results, nearly 9 million of them are trading or holding crypto balances.

The existing neobank market is somewhere vailued at $100 billion valuation with year‑over‑year user growth of 50 %.

Thus, if fully on‑chain neobanks can capture even a fraction of the next 15 million annual user additions, they can soon turn into mainstream financial services.

以下は、Mantleによる**完全オンチェーンの暗号資産ネオバンク「UR」**の発表について、予備知識のないビジネスパーソン向けにわかりやすく解説した内容です。事例と背景も踏まえて構成しています。

---

## ネオバンクとは何か？その進化系「Crypto Neobank」

ネオバンクとは、実店舗を持たずにスマートフォンやウェブだけで銀行サービスを提供する**デジタル専業銀行**のこと。欧州ではRevolutやN26などが有名です。

一方、「Crypto Neobank（暗号資産ネオバンク）」は、そのネオバンクの仕組みに**仮想通貨やDeFi（分散型金融）**の機能を統合した新たな形態です。

---

## Mantleが発表した「UR」は何がすごいのか？

Mantleは、イーサリアム上に構築されたLayer2ネットワーク。そこで発表されたURは、次の点で革新的です：

- **口座開設・送金・決済・貯蓄などの全てがブロックチェーン上で完結**
    
- EUR, USD, RMB, CHFといった法定通貨と仮想通貨を**ひとつの口座で管理可能**
    
- スイスの銀行ライセンスに準拠し、**法的にも安定性を確保**
    
- 現時点ではSWIFT・SEPA・Ethereum経由の送金に対応。将来的には**Mantle独自ネットワークに完全移行予定**
    

---

## 他の例：既存の「Cryptoに優しい銀行」との違い

- 例えば、RevolutやN26などは**「あとから追加された仮想通貨機能」**を提供しているに過ぎません。
    
- MantleのURは、**最初からブロックチェーンベースで設計された銀行**であり、「仮想通貨は付加機能」ではなく「中核機能」になっています。
    

---

## 将来の展望：URは“バンキングチェーン”へ

URは単なる金融アプリではなく、以下のような構想があります：

- ブロックチェーンを銀行のために最適化し、すべての**口座・取引・与信・利回り戦略**がスマートコントラクトで動作
    
- 2025年Q3に一般ユーザー向けに正式リリース予定
    
- 今後は**FX、法定通貨→仮想通貨変換、DeFi利回り運用、融資機能**などを提供
    

---

## なぜこれは大きな可能性を持つのか？

- 現在、ネオバンク市場は**1000億ドル規模**、年間成長率50%と急拡大
    
- Revolutは2024年だけで1500万人の新規ユーザーを獲得。そのうち約900万人が仮想通貨を利用中
    
- このトレンドを背景に、**「最初からDeFiと統合された銀行」**であるURの登場は、業界にとってゲームチェンジャーになる可能性あり
    

---

## 結論：URは「TradFi（伝統金融）とDeFiを本質的に融合」させる最前線

URのような完全オンチェーン型ネオバンクは、これからの金融サービスの標準を再定義する存在になるかもしれません。  
今後、**個人・法人がブロックチェーン上で銀行機能を使う時代の扉**が開かれようとしています。
