In March the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announced a [collaboration with Circle](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/nyse-owner-ice-to-explore-usdc-stablecoin-tokenized-fund-for-capital-markets/) to explore using its USDC stablecoin and its recently [acquired Hashnote USYC](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/stablecoin-firm-circle-buys-largest-tokenized-mmf-issuer-hashnote/) tokenized money market fund. One of the aims is to use them as collateral in its derivatives exchanges and clearing houses. ICE owns the New York Stock Exchange and operates several clearing houses around the world.

Chris Edmonds, the group’s President of Fixed Income and Data Services, recently discussed stablecoins and tokenized collateral with [Smartbrief](https://www.smartbrief.com/original/ices-edmonds-weighs-in-on-treasury-clearing-tokenization). Given the company’s interest in using stablecoins as collateral, he said that ICE had done some advocacy to influence the and STABLE Act, so there wasn’t “a delta between the collateral we hold in the clearing houses and the collateral likely backing stablecoins.”

Edmonds highlighted potential risks with longer dated Treasury reserves, describing a scenario where a large stablecoin using ten year Treasuries might face forced liquidation of large volumes. Longer dated bonds have greater price volatility, a major contributor to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The GENIUS Act stipulates that Treasury bills used as stablecoin reserves should be 93 days or less.

Clearing houses and derivatives exchanges typically use collateral comprising cash and high quality securities for margin purposes. Stablecoins represent a tokenized version of the cash component, while tokenized securities offer an alternative to traditional collateral.

ICE is not alone in exploring tokenization. In March the [CME](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/cme-to-trial-tokenization-on-googles-new-universal-ledger-dlt/) also announced tokenization trials, perhaps triggered by the CFTC’s plans for [tokenization pilots](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/cftc-unveils-plans-for-tokenized-collateral-pilot/). Plus, the [DTCC](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/dtcc-to-launch-tokenized-collateral-platform/) is launching a tokenized collateral platform. Meanwhile, in Europe, [Eurex](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/eurex-gets-bafin-approval-for-dlt-based-margin-collateral-via-hqla%e1%b5%a1-jp-morgan-to-go-first/) has regulatory approval to use digital collateral. There’s [sufficient interest](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/tokenization-of-collateral-derivatives-sector/) from the sector that the Futures Industry Association recently [published a report](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/futures-industry-association-is-keen-on-tokenized-mmf-as-collateral/) on the topic.

#### Benefits and concerns re tokenized assets

[Tokenized collateral’s](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/tokenized-collateral/) primary advantage is instant transferability, eliminating typical securities settlement delays. This proves particularly valuable for clearinghouses and variation margin at derivatives exchanges.

However, Edmonds expressed more reservations about tokenized collateral than stablecoins, despite acknowledging faster velocity benefits. His main concern centers on underlying assets: “The question is, what are we moving and what’s behind it?”

Circle’s USYC was specifically designed by Hashnote for clearinghouse use, addressing the preference for short dated Treasuries. Edmonds pointed to valuation challenges with assets like residential real estate tokenization, where significant valuation disagreements could arise.

The industry faces broader standardization challenges. In addition to the points made by Edmonds, we’d note that current tokenization structures vary widely, leaving some holders with weak claims to underlying securities. This becomes especially critical when tokenized Treasuries serve as stablecoin reserves.

The ICE executive’s reservations extended beyond valuation. He said his CTO asked “Why do we need to create a token, put it on a chain? What’s the difference between that and a database?” Edmonds responded that “there’s not really a difference, except for the points of accessibility along the way.”

Beyond accessibility, tokenization offers programmability features not fully exploited yet. While database owners traditionally control programmability, smart contracts can associate certain functions directly with tokenized assets. For example, a security in a repo transaction can automatically know when it needs to be returned.

ICE’s cautious approach reflects its commitment to thorough evaluation. Edmonds emphasized that “it’s our responsibility to make sure that we can innovate, but not to the point of just blowing everything up and saying, oh well, the new way is better because it’s new. That’s not necessarily always the case.”

![korean won stablecoin](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/korean-won-stablecoin.2-810x524.jpg)

Last week South published the [Basic Digital Asset Act](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/korean-legislation-plans-to-remove-stablecoin-oversight-from-central-bank/)  legislative bill, which gave significant powers of approval over [stablecoin](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/stablecoins/) issuers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC) rather than the Bank of Korea (BOK). That was despite recent [lobbying by the central bank](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/korean-central-bank-wants-influence-over-stablecoins-tether-available-to-koreans/) for a key supervisory role. Yesterday the Democratic Party of Korea, which won this month’s Presidential election, introduced complementary legislation that adjusts this regulatory framework, the Digital Asset Innovation Growth Act.

While the newer bill is meant to supplement the Basic Digital Asset Act, there’s considerable overlap, especially regarding stablecoin issuance. For example, the minimum capital requirement for an issuer was doubled from won 500 million ($360,000) to won 1 billion ($720,000). The new legislation also addresses some of the central bank’s earlier concerns about regulatory oversight by providing a role for BOK.

While issuer supervision still falls to the FSC, the central bank can express an opinion on any won stablecoin issuer and the FSC is obliged to comply unless it has a good reason. The Bank of Korea can also ask for stablecoin data from the issuer at any time and request that the Financial Services Commission perform an inspection, [Korea Economic Daily](https://www.hankyung.com/article/202506170381g) reported. There’s a lighter touch regulation for small issuers, which have not exceeded a billion won over the past year. The bill also states that won stablecoins are neither securities nor electronic money.

When the first bill was released last week, Yonhap News described the central bank’s reaction as “panic”. Yesterday BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong said, “I think a won-based stablecoin is necessary, and I don’t oppose its issuance.”

#### The Bank of Korea Governor’s stablecoin concerns

However, he has some reservations. “If a won-based stablecoin is issued, it will be easier to exchange for dollar-based stablecoins and make it difficult to manage foreign exchange,” he said according to [Nate News](https://news.nate.com/view/20250618n35486). This foreign exchange concern reflects broader worries about monetary policy control. South Korea has capital controls that aim to regulate the inflow and outflow of foreign currencies, especially the dollar.

News reports regarding both sets of regulations only mentioned the issuance of won-based stablecoins, not dollar ones which already circulate freely in the country. Tether recently announced plans to launch its USDT on the local Kaia public blockchain. USDC issuer Circle [reportedly](https://www.newsway.co.kr/news/view?ud=2025061813094451550) met with the central bank and National Assembly with plans to visit the FSC, triggering speculation that it might want to issue a Korean won stablecoin.

Meanwhile, the BOK Governor’s concerns extend from foreign exchange to the health of local banks. “If payment settlement business is transferred from banks to non-banks, we need to draw a big picture regarding the profitability of banks and changes in business structure.” This leans into long held concerns that if deposits migrate away from banks, it will inhibit their lending ability or loans will become more expensive.

The Governor concluded, “Once the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Financial Services Commission and other relevant ministries are in place, we plan to refine policies through inter-ministerial consultations.”

以下は、**ICE（インターコンチネンタル取引所）幹部のステーブルコイン＆トークン化担保に関する発言**について、予備知識のないビジネスパーソン向けにわかりやすく解説したものです。

---

## ICEとは何か？

ICE（Intercontinental Exchange）は、**ニューヨーク証券取引所（NYSE）を保有する世界最大級の金融インフラ企業**です。  
株式、債券、デリバティブなどの**取引所や清算機関（Clearing House）**を多数運営し、日々のグローバル金融取引の安全性を支える中核機関の一つです。

---

## 背景：なぜICEがステーブルコインやトークン担保に注目するのか？

2024年、ICEはステーブルコイン発行会社Circle（USDC）と連携し、**米国債を裏付けにしたトークン型マネー・マーケット・ファンド「USYC」**の活用を検討し始めました。  
その目的は、**「取引所の担保（証拠金）」としてステーブルコインやトークン資産を正式採用すること**です。

---

## 主な論点①：ステーブルコインの裏付け資産は「短期国債」であるべき

ICE幹部のエドモンズ氏は、次のようなリスクを指摘しました：

- ステーブルコインが**長期国債（例：10年債）**を担保にすると、価格が下落したときに**大量の強制売却が必要になるリスク**がある
    
- 実際にこのような長期債の評価損が、**シリコンバレーバンクの破綻要因**にもなった
    

このため、2025年の「GENIUS法案」では、**ステーブルコインの裏付けとして使える国債は「93日以内の短期債」に限定**されました。

---

## 主な論点②：トークン化資産には「何が裏にあるか」が最重要

ICEはトークン化の利点として「**即時決済（セトルメントの高速化）**」を認めていますが、それ以上に以下の懸念を抱いています：

- **裏付け資産が信頼できるか？**（例：不動産をトークン化した場合、価格の評価が難しい）
    
- **トークン化は本当に必要か？**（CTOの疑問：「それ、ただのデータベースでも良くない？」）
    
- 現状のトークン設計はバラバラで、**一部では裏付け資産の法的請求権が弱い**という問題も
    

---

## 業界の動き：他社も「慎重に」トークン化を進行中

- CME（シカゴ・マーカンタイル取引所）やDTCC（米国証券決済機関）もトークン化試験を開始
    
- 欧州ではEurexが**「規制承認済みのデジタル担保」**を導入
    
- こうした動きに対応し、業界団体FIAも報告書を発行
    

---

## 結論：ICEのスタンスは「革新するが、壊さない」

ICEはブロックチェーンやトークン化に前向きながらも、**「伝統的な金融の信頼性」を壊さない慎重なアプローチ**を取っています。  
エドモンズ氏は「**新しいからと言って、それが常に優れているわけではない**」と強調し、イノベーションとリスク管理の両立を重視しています。

---

📌ポイントまとめ

- ステーブルコインには「短期国債担保」が鍵
    
- トークン担保は即時性◎だが、裏付け資産の信頼性が課題
    
- トークン化は「技術的革新」ではなく「金融制度の再設計」そのもの
    
- ICEは最前線を見据えつつも、堅実な実装を選ぶ姿勢
