I’ve already shown you how altseason tops often form when Others OI > $BTC OI

Now here’s something that might help you spot $ETH tops and bottoms too and it’s spooky accurate

It’s based on global liquidity cycles.

Here’s the logic:

When ETH trades above the red line (liquidity top band), it tends to top out.

When it dips below the green line (liquidity bottom band), it tends to bottom out.

\- Jan 2018, May 2021, April 2022 → $ETH was above the red band → 60–80% drops followed.

\- Dec 2018, March 2020, June 2022, April 2025 → $ETH went below green band → massive gains followed.

Right now?

ETH is ~$2.4K.

The red band is way up at ~$3.8K.

That’s a big buffer. It tells me one thing:

$ETH isn’t anywhere near the top. In fact, with global liquidity rising again, the red band is only gonna shift higher.

So if ETH crosses $6K in the short term.. wouldn’t surprise me at all.

Big shoutout to @alphaextract\_ for the data.
