## Introduction to Free AI Agents Course

0:00

free AI agents course build and automate anything So I'm about to show you how to

0:06

build and automate absolutely anything with AI agents completely for free in

0:11

this massive 5hour mega course I'll walk you through every single automation you

0:17

see behind me step by step And you're going to learn how to build AI agents to handle your entire business whilst you

0:24

sleep the exact framework I use to automate complex workflows that used to take hours and my secret techniques for

0:31

building AI agents that actually make you money on autopilot There's also time stamps so feel free to skip to the

0:37

automations you want the most Today what I'm going to show you is how to scrape anything free with NA10 and this scraper

## Scraping Data with NA 10 and Appify

0:43

agent and I'll give you the full template for free You're going to see for example how I easily scrape for free

0:48

using Ampify all of these leads for free without coded And I'll give you the downloadable template for free too So

0:54

you don't even need to set this up yourself And you'll discover my exact step-by-step process to build personalized AI outreach emails for your

1:00

scrape leads And you can even send them over to a Google sheet and then fill in all the details right there Now you can do this for pretty much anything So

1:07

using Ampify which I'll show you exactly how to do today and you can get free usage like you see in the bottom left down there You can get access to for

1:13

example like Instagram scrapers or tweets or Facebook groups or Facebook group comments etc Anything that you

1:19

want to scrape you can scrape leads and data in seconds and build personalized AI outreach emails from them all as well

1:24

Come on to that later too And this is the exact system you can use to scrape pretty much whatever you want in seconds without coding and then link it to AI

1:31

video 3 This AI YouTube video automation is absolutely insane So this actually

## Automating YouTube Video Creation with AI

1:36

created with an automation using N like you can see Let me play back the video and I'll show you some examples

1:43

[Music] I can't believe I just did that

1:51

So super high quality That is Yeti losing his selfie stick in the snow This is Bigfoot making a squirrel smoothie

1:59

Out folks Totally organic wild squirrel smoothie straight from my backyard

2:06

We got the Yeti using chopsticks over here How do people even do this

2:16

We also have can you believe this They're actually dancing

2:22

[Music] Bigfoot dancing in the jungle with a vlogger annotating it Right So the way

2:30

that we've automated this is with this workflow right here Basically what we've got is a a AI video generator Now you

2:37

can tailor this to your business You could use this for ads and advertising that sort of thing And basically what we're doing here is just saying for this

2:44

create a prompt a caption an idea etc And we've actually prompted the AI to

2:51

generate video prompt ideas based on this right So you can take this all to your business or to to whatever niche

2:57

you're in But these videos can absolutely blow up For example if you actually been on YouTube and we have a

3:03

look here we type in for example 3 Bigfoot You can see like one of the top

3:08

searches now is actually pigfoot videos made with Vo3 It's absolutely popping off on there and people are super

3:14

interested in it So if you're thinking about like generating AI videos with Vo3

3:20

and then automating it this is one of the easiest and best workflows I know So what it's going to do from here inside

## Generating and Managing AI Video Outputs

3:25

LA10 is it's going to take those videos and then map them to a spreadsheet that looks something like this Right So for

3:32

example you got the idea the caption the production the environment and the final output And basically this whole

3:37

automation not just comes up with the idea not just generates a video but also logs all of that including the URL

3:44

directly in a spreadsheet so that you can easily track and keep track of all the stuff that you've generated And you

3:50

could easily I actually changed this from Bigfoot to Yeti this morning I could easily change it to a business You

3:56

could easily change it to whatever niche you're in But the whole point here is like you can generate probably the best quality videos you can possibly find

4:04

when it comes to AI with this workflow And the crazy thing about this as well is like you've got the audio lip synced

4:10

inside So you don't need to use any sort of audio generation separately All the APIs are just with A3 and it's super

4:16

simple to implement You got the AI coming up with the idea the AI generating the prompts for the AI So the

4:24

AI prompting AI and then you've got the video being generated here Now if you want the workflow and the template for

4:30

this it's inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description You can just download this template from me and

4:35

then import it into NA10 and it will literally look like this and you just customize it how you want All right so

4:42

if we get back to this now it's going to generate the idea to sheets So we've got the details of the caption etc And you

4:50

can post this straight to Instagram with the caption and the hashtags and everything else And then from here with

4:56

the NA10 agent what it's actually going to do is take the capture and the idea and the en environment And these are

5:01

dynamic So it changes every time you generate the outputs And that is going to use

5:07

VER3 to generate a prompt Right So it's going to say create a VER3 prompt based

5:12

on this Here's the environment And in the prompt explain like the situation the environment who's vlogging etc These

5:18

are the outputs we get back So in a bright neon lit cave a giant yeti films himself clumsily trying to eat a bowl of

5:24

cereal using oversized chopsticks which is exactly what we got on this

5:30

automation over here with a bunch of penguins in the background having a great time All right And then we also

5:36

have the system message So we have the prompt which is going to be dynamic each time based on the ideas from the AI And

5:42

then we have the system message for the AI to just make sure that the prompt is actually good and you know you want to

5:48

refine it because if you don't sometimes AI is not going to give you full context

5:54

or the prompt that it generates not going to be very good and so that's why we have the system message and the prompt over here now this is where it

6:01

gets interesting so stage number three is actually creating the video and we're using something called foul to generate

6:07

this right so you can see here I've set the HTTP request the post the URL as the

6:13

foul API over here and using foul is actually pretty because you get loads of different APIs like for example some

6:19

people will be watching this and they'll be saying I can't afford to use VR3 API etc which is totally fine and so what

6:25

you can actually do if you go to the explore section inside foul is you can use other APIs so for example they have

6:31

cling which is actually a lot cheaper I believe and you also have even older models right so for example if you don't

6:36

want to use veo3 you could use for example like the old version of cling or you could use veo2 in your image and

6:43

video generations too as well so you know if you want cheaper ways around That's one of the easiest ways to do it

6:49

And then you can plug in the endpoint here The credential type I've used a

6:57

header And basically what you're going to do is put authorization as a name and then key space and then your API key

7:03

inside the settings there Right So you can just add a credential for logging in And then we can rename this as well So

7:09

I'm going to rename this For example let's put foul login details And then the good

7:16

thing about that is like I've got those login details ready to go The credentials are saved and I can just generate outputs anytime I want Right

7:22

And then inside the body we are taking the JSON using the body type prompt and

7:28

that's going to send the prompt from our spreadsheet over to FA which is then

7:34

going to use VO3 to generate the video Now inside the batching section over here we've got one item to batch and

7:41

we're going to wait 2,000 milliseconds to batch that in between batches right So if you're generating multiple videos

7:47

at one time this just gives the API enough time to generate outputs without getting overloaded Okay so far we've

7:54

generated the idea We've plugged that into a spreadsheet The AI has come up with the prompt for A3 and then we've

8:00

plugged this into foul Now we've also got a wait section here because the thing is if you want the actual output

8:06

so this is the output from foul for Veo3's video It's going to take a little

8:12

while to load I might take 3 minutes to generate that video And so what we like to do here on this side is we're going

8:19

to wait for 250 seconds before we actually try and pull out the outputs And that just allows us to wait before

8:26

we actually ask for the video If you ask too early if you have no weight then you know it's not going to pull in the right

8:33

URL And then after this we've got a HTTP request which is get right We're using

8:39

our foul login details that we plugged in before and we are taking the request

8:45

ID plugging that into the end of FU's endpoint Right So this is the endpoint

8:51

for requests And then we take the JSON request ID which is dynamic each time and then it automatically grabs the URL

8:58

of the MP4 file that we can download Right Why do we want to do that Because otherwise you're going to lose a video

9:03

and you won't be able to find it So you want to keep these inside a spreadsheet so that it's neat it's organized And also if you want to plug this into say

9:11

YouTube or Instagram or Tik Tok automatically which I'll show you how to do in a second then this allows you to

9:18

do that And so we've got all these different videos generated with AI and we can just keep a track Also you could

9:24

schedule loads of content and then come back to it later as well which is pretty cool So from here we have generated the

9:30

video We've waited 3 minutes and then from this point we have gathered the

9:35

response of the URL Right So we've got the file video details back After that we just want to plug in the final URL

9:42

which we only get at the end of the automation back into the spreadsheet as you can see over here And we are good to

9:48

go on that my friends All right So that's basically how the whole automation works You can grab the

9:54

template inside the AI profit boardroom Feel free to get it Link in the comments description If you're wondering okay how

## Cost and Efficiency of AI Video Generation

10:00

much does this cost you each time Let me show show you an example So if we go to usage over here we can see how much it

10:07

costs us each time to generate the outputs And you can see we've spent I've spent $26 on Veo3 just testing this out

10:16

And that was me trying to figure out how to do this workflow So for you it's going to be even cheaper And then if we

10:21

click on this we can see our recent

10:26

requests over here

10:32

Right And then if we go back into the

10:38

usage So I've used I've created two different workflows today and it's cost

10:43

me so I think it's cost me $6 today to use this Sorry how much is that $12 So

10:49

it's cost me $6 each time to generate a video Just being 100% honest with you So these two videos one one hour ago

10:57

another one another hour ago and you can see the videos generated right here Now

11:02

also what I'd recommend here is inside the idea

11:11

generator you can actually keep generating more ideas So if you don't like the first one you can

11:17

click generate again right And then you can just test this out So if we click on this this is using chat GBT to come up

11:24

with the ideas We'll wait for that to load and we'll get the outputs

11:31

Zaga is asking Veo3 which is paid version Yes So it's paid to use this API

11:36

Like I said if you want a free ver sorry if you want a cheaper version then you can just switch between APIs inside foul

11:42

right So if you want to use like a cheaper video generation method then you can use pretty much the same method but

11:49

instead of using Veo 3 which is of course the most expensive right now you could use cling 2 or you could use ve as

11:57

well The other thing I would say here as well is that obviously right now it's expensive to use but it's only going to

12:02

get cheaper And also if you're making money with a monetized channel then you're going to make that money back anyway And it's just a lot faster So

12:10

like for example if you're thinking okay I've got a choice I can spend hours messing around with this manually or I

12:17

can pay for this sort of API and then generate the video and save myself 2 hours of time then you would go if

12:24

you're a serious business owner you would go with saving the time On average the videos generated are 8 seconds So

12:30

you can see Bayer 3 always goes with 8 seconds 8 seconds But what you can actually do is stitch these together

12:36

right Which is something I'll show you in a second So I just want to show you the ideas of what we've generated here So for example Yeti vlog goals etc It's

12:44

come up with loads of cool ideas right there which is awesome All right So we've come up with

12:51

different ideas If you want to generate another one you can There we go So this is Yeti filming his morning

12:59

routine with giant pancakes And then we can generate a full video on that So if you want to figure out okay how do you

13:07

stitch these together Let me show you an example So we actually have inside the AI profit

## Advanced AI Video Automation Techniques

13:14

boardroom this workflow

13:21

And basically what it does is it stitches automatically videos together So let me show you an

13:28

example This is probably the easiest way to create long form AI videos from what I know so far So for example if we have

13:36

a look at this video this is multiple AI videos generated together in an NATM

13:41

workflow And you can stitch them together that way And that's all automated So you don't need to do any video editing So let me show you exactly

13:47

how that works If we go back to NA10 over

14:00

here All right Inside NA10 what we can do is click on create workflow And then

14:06

inside create workflow we're going to grab that short workflow like this We'll

14:13

download that Then we're going to go over to N8N We're going to import from

14:19

file the shorts JSON That's going to have all of these files And then what

14:25

you want to do is you can see this stitch video module right here And

14:30

basically you can take all the outputs from foul and

14:36

using the meg API from foul you can actually

14:42

stitch multiple videos together like you can see So this is taking all the videos from here plugging them into an

14:49

automation here and then we have all the videos just locked together right And so

14:55

you can insert that into your workflow and then using that you're going to wait probably about I would say a couple of

15:01

seconds to stitch them together and get that final video together So for example if we pull this

15:10

up this using the meg API stitches all the videos together

15:17

from that previous generation right And so that's how you can generate like longer videos And then for example you

15:23

could generate five videos stitch them all together And also with this automation that's inside the AR profit

15:28

boardroom what you can actually do is you can generate multiple different story lines together So what it does for

15:35

example is it takes an idea like for example a monkey stealing a GoPro plugs

15:41

it into 13 different scenes as you can see So there's 13 different scenes using

15:46

this automation And then from there we can put that through foul again

15:54

generate all the videos like you can see So we've created 13 different videos and then you can stitch them together with

16:01

the foul meg API So that's how you can create multiple videos stitch them together in an automation and you're

16:07

good to go Someone's asking like what are the

16:12

benefits to use NA10 with GitHub I've never really used GitHub with NASA 10 so I'm not gonna be SEO there and I just

16:17

want to be 100% transparent If it's something that's really popular we'll usually build it inside the AI profit

16:23

bordering for people But yeah I don't know I don't really use GitHub that much

16:28

I just like to be proactive So basically that's how you can basically take

16:34

the automation generate the video come up with ideas stitch them together and

16:40

then for the auto posting let me show you how auto posting works So I'm just going to leave that We'll create a

16:45

workflow here inside the AI profit boardroom You can grab this template and

16:51

I'll walk you through it in a second but essentially you can automate content across YouTube Tik Tok Facebook threads

## Automating Social Media Posting

16:57

Twitter etc So if we take this blueprint then we're going to go back

17:03

into NA10 and we'll import this

17:09

blueprint Here we go And now inside NA10 what you can do is

17:15

you can actually schedule the automation to check your spreadsheet like once a day it will

17:22

check the NA10 automation with all the URLs etc So you can see for example here

17:27

it's pulled in the information from the spreadsheet and on the outputs you've got all the details of the caption and

17:33

everything else that's going to send it over to blow as you can see and blow

17:39

using its API can then post to Tik Tok and that's how we automated that post to Tik Tok that I showed you earlier right

17:45

and so you can take the videos from your spreadsheet which are logged right here

17:51

run it through blow potato and then you could plug that through for example Instagram YouTube Tik Tok Facebook etc

17:58

And so using this you can automate the whole creation of the video automate

18:05

stitching the videos together so you don't need a video editor And then from there you can actually use this

18:10

automation inside the AI profit boardroom to automate posting it to social media as well And so you can see

18:16

that with N810 you save time All you're doing is clicking a button It al it

18:22

saves hours on like video editing uploading the content manually And also like you can scale this right So for

18:28

example you can imagine that if you were trying to build five or 10 different Tik Tok accounts or even more like you're

18:34

not going to use a manual process where you have to rely on humans to upload the caption and the video and everything

18:39

else what would be much smarter as a business owner is to use automations like these where you can just save a lot

18:45

of time and that's a benefit really Also the other benefit of using N8 as a workflow is that it automates the idea

18:51

generation as well as the prompt generation and you just you've saved yourself clicking about 100 buttons

18:57

which would be totally pointless when you can automate it with NA10 So that's a benefit And also you can just log this

19:03

all in a spreadsheet You can imagine how annoying that would be to plug this all in manually So you saving yourself if

19:09

you scale this up you save yourself dozens of hours really So that's how the whole process works If you want the

19:15

workflow it's inside the AI profit boardroom You can see for example we have inside here the NA10 automation We

19:23

also have the reals automation and everything else If you want to see an example of a Tik Tok account that's

19:29

doing this and absolutely smashing it you can see an example of Bigfoot Boys Tik Tok account 3.1 million 36,000 views

19:38

Like it's just it's insane how well this works And the videos are really cool And you can automate that with NA10 I've

19:45

included the Google sheet template as well in here and the auto poster link as well So you can just steal this stuff

19:52

from me along with the viral reels workflow too if you want to stitch this stuff up So feel free to get that inside

19:57

the air profit boardroom What we also do inside here and this is what inspired me to actually create this automation is we

20:02

post and basically ask you what do you want us to create and then we create that automation for you Right So

20:08

whatever automations you want we can build them within reason inside the AR profit boarding You can also ask any

20:14

questions you have This is where I hang out So if you want to ask me questions personally you can And also on top of

20:19

that you don't just get automations built for you You don't just get all the automations I've shown you You don't

20:24

just get the community access but also get three live coaching calls per week And if you can't access them or if you

20:30

can't make the live calls then you can watch it back inside the AI automation examples inside here

20:37

Also have a YouTube AI video course here So if you want to learn about how to make money of YouTube based on how I've

20:43

got over 22 million views on YouTube and made hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions of dollars from YouTube

20:49

then you can get that inside the AR profit boardroom All right And if you're just like "Okay Julian I want you to automate all this stuff for me and just

20:56

implement it for my business." We can do that So feel free to book in an AI discovery session link in the comments

21:01

description We can jump on that call look at your business and then show you exactly what you need to do step by step

21:08

Also if you're wondering okay what are some cheaper alternatives Because I know some people will be asking like is this free blah blah blah So we actually have

21:15

some free alternatives inside the AI profit boardroom

## Creating AI Avatars and Automating Video Creation

This new AI avatar automation is absolutely insane using Hey Gen and NA10 So this video actually that I created

21:28

right here actually generated and you can do it all in one click using NA10 This workflow that I'll show you how to

21:33

access today Let's play it back and see exactly how it works Hey everyone it's

21:39

Julian Goldie here Today let's dive into some fascinating AI news First up UK

21:45

courts So the actual script was fully generated with NA10 The video then went

21:52

through to Hey Genen It was automatically posted using this workflow right here Now if you want a super basic

21:58

version right So if you don't even want to generate the script and you want to edit the script yourself I'll start with

22:03

that just to make it easy and to show you how this works step by step So essentially what you're going to do this

22:08

is the first step is make sure that you set up your own avatar Now I did this as

22:13

an example today It was really quick and easy Literally you can see I generated

22:18

this morning It's a video of me Hey Julian Goldie SEO

22:25

And you can also change the voice So if we go inside here we can select this

22:30

voice right here Let's play that back Hey there Here's how I sound Hope you like it So this is using my clone of my

22:38

voice using 11 Labs And then we've got the avatar video right here You can change the resolution to 4K as well You

22:44

can also change whether you want it as a circle So for example screencast half body close-up etc And if we go back to

22:51

the editing over here and basically you can add like 300 different looks and angles And you can even take these from

22:57

videos Now when you're generating the avatar if you wanted to create a photo look you can just go to your avatar

23:04

click add a new look and then use photos Or if you want to record your own video you only need like a 30 second video to

23:10

train this up like you can see right here So it's pretty easy and simple to do very quick And then using that

23:18

process you're going to create a HTTPS request on NA10 So you would just go

23:25

to add node HTTP request and using that you can

23:31

start creating the video It's as simple as that right So you can see for example here the way that we've set this up

23:37

we've used post the URL is this one So this is from HEN's

23:49

endpoint which you can get the documentation for right here By the way if you want all this stuff it's inside

23:54

the the AI success lab has all the links to everything that I'm talking about And then if you want to get the actual

24:00

template it's inside the AR profit boardroom So you can just download this and import it directly yourself But if

24:05

we go back to hen now basically what we're doing is we're loading these details into NA10 What you can do is

24:12

even imports here URL and just take this and import But basically we got method

24:19

as post URL is this The credential type I've put header and off and then I've saved my hen login details To use hen

24:28

and login as a post request you're going to use the name as xy API key And then

24:34

for the value you just grab an API key which is pretty simple and easy to do If you go over to let's have a look

24:43

Julian settings subscriptions and API And then you can just grab an API key

24:49

over here like you can see or you can refresh and create a new one So that's basically how you get the API key and

24:54

set up the login credentials Then we send the headers and

25:00

we use the headers below So accept application/json and for the send body we use JSON using JSON and if we pull

25:07

this up you can see how I've set this up right so my avatar ID is plugged in here

25:13

this is the input text just as an example and this is the voice ID right so if you're wondering okay how do I

25:19

customize this to my avatar to my business number one you set up the credentials for hey genen once you've

25:25

done that then you're going to plug in the avatar ID right how do you get the avatar ID so what you do is you go back

25:31

to Hey Gem you go to avatars you go to the avatar that you want to grab and then you find the specific scene or

25:37

video that you want to plug in Right So for example if you go to the three dots at the top copy avatar ID then go back

25:44

to NA10 plug it in there you're good to go All right Now for the voice you can

25:49

do the same thing So if we go to AI voice then we can go to the voice

25:55

clone Then we can get the voice ID And we can plug that into the voice ID

26:02

over here And then this text if you've got your own script that you want to plug in you can just paste it in right

26:09

So you would paste it in between the quote marks right here That's basically how it's set up You can also change the dimensions there as well So that's nice

26:14

and easy Let's say for example you wanted to generate a landscape video or that sort of thing You can quite easily

26:21

And then from here literally all you do is you just send that to to Hey Gen right So for

26:27

example if I say okay I like YouTube just as an example

26:32

the text we'll hit test like so we'll hit execute node and then you can see

26:38

that's generating right now if we go back to home inside n10 sorry inside hen you can

26:46

see the hen avatar being generated in the top left sorry top in the bottom left over here so that's taking the API

26:53

and then plugging this through hen pretty simple and And then all you need to do is just grab the URL of the video

27:00

you want to retrieve Right So for example if we go to this HTTP request you can change the method to get URL as

27:08

this credential type as this and then using fields below video ID and we take

27:13

the video ID right And then we send the headers accept application JSON And

27:18

that's pretty much it And then just make sure you got the credentials set up So that's it for the very simplified

27:25

method right So we've got that video generated

27:31

using the API over here Let's click play on this I like

27:36

YouTube I like YouTube It's not bad right It's not bad at all It's pretty convincing I think if you look at that

27:43

versus the video you're looking at now pretty similar to be honest with you And then if we go to test over here So let's

27:49

click on test step What that's going to do is it's going to

27:57

take the video URL like you can see over

28:04

here I like YouTube And that is a video URL that we just generated from NA10

28:10

Obviously it was a super short example but you could make it much longer if you're willing to wait And that's

28:15

basically the simplified SP and template Now if you want to get that inside the AR profit boardroom you can grab the

28:21

basic version right there If you download that and

28:27

then I'll delete these just as an example And then we import the file that

28:34

we just downloaded the JSON that you can get from the AR profit boardroom That's ready to go and ready to set up Right

28:40

now if you want a more advanced version which is way more practical and useful in real life then you can use this

28:47

process right And this is way more powerful So essentially what we're doing here is we are actually automating the

28:54

research and the script writing and then plugging that through Hey Gen right And so the way this works is you can

## Research and Script Writing Automation

29:01

actually just go inside the chat here is you can go inside the chat and then you

29:06

can send a message and tell it exactly what you want Right What that's going to do from

29:13

there is take the message or the topic that you want to research and start generating the

29:20

outputs Right So for example if we go to the research agent over here this is connected to firecraw So you can see

29:26

it's connected to firecrawl over here and it's doing a firecrawl search from Reddit to get the latest news Right So

29:32

it says for example search Reddit for the keyword I give you search useful post finding relevant marketing insights

29:38

generate content concepts blah blah blah use a fire crawl tool for search So that's using the attached scroll and

29:44

then this will take the latest information from today off Reddit and then generate a script later using

29:52

that scraped information from firecraw And by the way firecrawl is free to use I haven't paid for it Right So if you if

30:00

we look at this research assistant we put in the chat input AI news today It

30:05

came up with this output So it grabs all the notable AI news insights from Reddit today And then what that's going to do

30:12

is relay that information over to our script writing agent Right So if we go to the script writing agent over

30:19

here you can see it's like here's some news insights And what we're saying is based on the research from today right

30:25

So from that previous module write a short fun script for my YouTube video And then inside the system message we

30:31

said you're a helpful script writing assistant And then also you want to make sure that you just put this in like

30:37

plain text because if you generate the outputs in any other format then it doesn't seem to get recognized when you

30:43

send this over to ajen right because it has to be like plain text If you have any formatting or HTML or that sort of

30:49

thing it's going to mess up the JSON later So keep that as normal And then it said hey Julian it's hey everyone it's

30:55

Julian Goldie today Here's what we're doing blah blah blah And then it created a short script Now obviously like you'd

31:01

want that in a real life situation to be like a thousand words or 2,000 words which you can easily do using the script

31:07

write agent just change your prompts inside here right so once you've done that you've automated the research from

31:13

today which is useful in itself as an NA10 automation you've automated the script writing which is also pretty

31:18

useful but the most important part here is generating the avatar video right so

31:24

what we've done here is using that hey genen method exactly the same inputs as we organized before we're sending that

31:30

to Hen and then from Hen we are using a HTTP request generating the video and

31:38

then we've got that good to go using Hen Now at this point you might be saying

31:43

"Okay that's great You can automate the research You can automate the scripts You can automate the video creation

31:48

using an AI avatar Whoopsy-doo." But how do you actually post this to other platforms So what we've actually got

31:54

inside the AR profit boardroom as well is this automation which you can download from the AR profit boardroom

32:00

right So you can download the hen template templates right here What we can actually do from there is we can use

32:07

blow and the auto posting automation So let me show you an example of

32:16

that So using this NA10 auto posting workflow we can actually post directly

32:21

to whatever platform we want right Using blow and blow basically takes the

32:27

URLs from your previous workflow and plugs that through Tik Tok or YouTube or

32:32

Instagram whatever right So you can see for example here you can use this on Instagram YouTube Tik Tok Facebook

32:38

threads Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest etc And essentially what you're doing is you

32:44

are going to take the URL put that into Blotato upload the video and then send it over

32:50

right Pretty simple and easy If you want an example of that in practice let me show

32:56

you You can go to the profile and then grab that video over here So just to be

33:01

very clear here you can get this from the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description You've got the auto

33:07

posting workflow that you can import right

33:12

here You have the Hey Gen NA10 automation that you can import right here If you like video automation stuff

33:19

like this then I would also recommend checking out the Beao3 automation You can do some really cool stuff with that

33:25

as well And this is all available to download inside the AI profit boarding right So you can just grab these JSON

33:32

files you can upload those into NA10 and you can automate video creation very easily right And I think to be honest

33:39

that's the future of social media to be honest with you Like how are people going to compete with videos of Bigfoot

33:45

or Yeti for example If Bigfoot was presenting this video as a screencast and you had a choice between that and me

33:53

you're probably going to watch the Bigfoot screencast because it's way more interesting and attention grabbing And also even like the

33:59

way that this process works it's way more automated right It's way faster and

34:05

efficient which means there's going to be more content flooding the internet and therefore it's going to perform really well right So I think that's

34:11

something that you definitely want to start thinking about now Whether it is for your business whether you're trying to make money with video whether you're

34:17

trying to get more customers etc We're going to be implementing it into our own business it's pretty simple and easy to

34:22

do and I've shown you exactly how using this step-by-step process Right You can do this with Hey Gen you can do this

34:28

with A3 The outputs are really good You can also for

34:37

example create your own films and stuff like that as well So let me show you an example of that If we go back to Hey Jen

34:43

over here you can even create avatars like here's an example of Yeti

34:50

right So this is Yeti vlogging The audio was synced as well to the photo and that

34:57

can be automated using Hey Jen as well You've got another example of a Roman soldier So you can create like films out

35:03

of this as you can see and also even UGC And what I mean by that is like ads

35:09

right So for example if we have a look at this video

35:16

do you want highquality backlinks Click the link below to get started You can see how easy that is to do right there

35:22

Carlos asks "Why did you decide to use Reddit Can this also crawl X?" Yes it can crawl Twitter as well So for example

35:29

if you wanted to use Twitter instead let me show you how that would work in reality So for example if we go back

35:37

to that NASA workflow and then we go to the research agent and then inside here

35:43

we can just say okay search Twitter or X for the keyword I give you We can test

35:48

that step We'll unpin and test that All right So we're looking at AI

35:56

news today It's going to use firecrawl to crawl Twitter And then you can say and then

36:03

you can see here it says here are some recent posts about AI news what's happening etc And then you can generate

36:10

the script based on that right so if we take the recent posts about AI news we

36:19

can easily do that Let me go

36:26

inside the examples What we need to do is just change this to Twitter inside the system

36:37

message Let's click test on that

37:12

And then if we go to the HTTP request over here we just need to change this to

37:19

x.com So change the query So this fire crawl tool is currently using it was

37:27

using reddit.com but we're going to change that to x.com Let's go back to the research agent now We'll test our

37:35

step for Leo says "Have you He's posted it three times mate Chill chill out." So

37:42

have you seen Google Workspace Vid Store You can search Google images GIFs videos

37:47

etc Right in the tool I think it could be automated with scripts Yeah I think that could be something good as well

37:53

Yeah it's another thing to look at But if we go back to x.com we can now see

37:58

that it's scraping x.com right So you can see inside the URL it's looking at x.com specifically And then from here we

38:04

can go back to the script writing agent We can unpin and test that It will

38:10

take the information from x.com and then use that to generate the script Right So OpenAI just made wave by

38:17

acquiring journey blah blah blah

38:29

And if we go to the news just to clarify and make sure that's correct So this is

38:35

saying about Joanie and OpenAI's AI company acquisition from OpenAI If we go

38:41

here you can see that news was just announced a day ago So it is literally scraping the latest news from X and then

38:48

using that to generate the outputs Now this in itself these two modules right here are amazing right Like these two

38:55

modules you could use pretty much every single day for any business that you're in because you want to stay up to date So you could literally if you wanted to

39:02

you could just

39:07

delete you could delete that section and just have this as like your own research and script writing tool right or blog

39:13

writing tool or whatever But if you want to automate AI videos on

39:19

top of that then it's quite easy to add this stage free as you can see And you can get all of this automation inside

39:24

the AI profit boardroom Just go to the Hey Gen NA10 automation You can see all the other stuff that we've built here So

39:30

for example like a firecrawl Reddit bot that could be used for X or anything else We've got a Veo3 NA10 automator hey

39:37

Genen automator translation bot like even a social media post as well So you

39:42

can see this crazy social media post right here So all these workflows are inside the AI profit boardroom Feel free

39:48

to get it link in the comments description and you can download these

39:54

workflows and then just import them into NA10 We also do three weekly live coaching calls per week So you can see

39:59

here Tuesday Wednesday and Saturday we also sorry Tuesday Wednesday and Friday we do coaching calls live that you can

40:06

jump on If you have any questions in between you can post in the community ask me anything What we also do is each

40:12

week we ask you like what automations do you want us to build for you and we'll just go off and build them So whatever

40:18

you want to see we're going to build those automations and we're going to share them with the community as well so that everyone gets access and the value

40:25

of this community just improves every single day We're pretty much adding new automations and new cool stuff based on

40:31

what people want to see and we just listen to you and your ideas right So feel free to get that inside there a profit boardroom and then

40:37

also you can post in the community you can connect with me loads of benefits

40:42

for being in there and also you get all the systems that work for me right now so all the stuff that's allowed me to scale my business make money I've

40:49

actually inserted as templates inside the AI profit boardroom feel free to get that link in the comments description

40:55

and if you want to get a done for you service where we just

41:02

implement AI for you we can look your business and figure out okay what do you need to automate and then how can we do

41:07

that We can do that for you fully hands-free and you can just book in a call link in the comments description We're happy to do that for you We call

41:13

it the AI time machine method because we're saving you hundreds of hours using this process For example if your time is

41:19

worth like $100 to $500 per hour and you free up 100 100 hours per month you're

41:25

saving $10 to $50,000 per month It's a great investment So feel free to get that link in the comments description

41:30

and you can book that in directly appreciate you watching and I will see you on the next one peeps Cheers Bye-bye

41:37

Today I'm going to show you how I automated with Veo3 this video using an

41:42

NA10 workflow I'll show you exactly how to get the template today as well Let's play back this video I'll show you exactly what we've got here folks

41:48

Totally organic wild squirrel smoothie straight from my backyard

41:53

So that is Bigfoot vlogging and this was actually inspired by a Tik Tok account that's absolutely blowing up You can see

42:00

using a similar sort of process They're creating videos with Bigfoot Vlogging but I actually turned it into an

42:07

automated workflow like you can see right here where you can just click a button and generate these sort of videos

42:12

as you want Now step by step let me run you through exactly how it works and how

42:17

to use this automation By the way if you want to steal this from me you can get it inside the AR profit boardroom link

42:23

in the comments description Veo3 automation You can see all the templates right here plus the import JSON file so

42:29

that you can just steal this stuff from me right You don't have to even set it up yourself So as we can see right here

42:35

we have the trigger for the automation And so basically you can just schedule this to run like every 24 hours Or if

42:42

you automated this to a Tik Tok account or Instagram account which I'll show you how to do later then you can use this

42:48

process You just automatically schedule the content that you create directly to

42:54

Tik Tok orever Right As an example of that here is a video I actually

43:00

automatically posted using AI to my Tik Tok account It was pretty easy and simple to do using the processes that

43:06

I'll show you today So as we get into this we've got the schedule trigger This is going to run every 24 hours Then we

43:12

have the ideas generator right And basically what we're doing here is we're saying like give me a funny idea related

43:18

to Bigfoot vlogging in the jungle Here you can just customize this to whatever you want For example let's say you

43:23

wanted to have I don't know aliens doing like an MTV crib style video You could

43:28

just change the prompts right here step by step Pretty easy and simple And then we also have a system message down below

43:36

which shows exactly how to create the caption how to generate the idea how to set up the environment so that we create

43:43

really nice outputs from the videos that we generate Okay so we've got chat GPT

43:48

generating the prompt based on our niche You can change the niche to whatever you want This could actually be really good

43:54

for ads as well I was thinking for for example for generating like UGC I don't know for our SEO agency maybe Bigfoot

44:01

promoting SEO backlinks using this process we could easily generate that like it's not even difficult at this

44:07

point so it's absolutely mind-blowing you can see the outputs right here so it's generated the caption Bigfoot vlogs

44:14

the idea Bigfoot shares his breakfast totally organic squirrel smoothie environment in a vibrant jungle big foot

44:20

holds his camera with fairy hands right now you can actually check this step by step So if you're like I don't really

44:26

like this right I don't I want something new So if you click test step again what they actually do is redo the automation

44:32

and then you can generate another idea another idea right And just generate whatever you want So for example here's

44:37

another one It said Bigfoot's wild adventures Bigfoot shows off his breakfast tree bark mushroom smoothies

44:44

in a vibrant jungle Bigfoot spins around with a selfie stick Chaos and use Right And he's got all the captions the ideas

44:50

etc So that is stage number one of the process What I've actually done is broken it down into four stages just so

44:57

it's easy to understand So you can see this is the idea generation section And you also want to add a structured output

45:03

passer so that you can generate the JSON from the text you generate right So the

45:08

AI agent creates this text and then the output passer from JSON actually

45:14

separates that into caption idea environment everything else Pretty simple and easy Now what that's going to

45:19

do from here once you've generated the ideas is it's going to move on to the video prompts For example if we check

45:25

this out this is our ideas This is generated via a Google sheet So we're logging all the ideas that we generate

45:32

and everything else into a nice little spreadsheet with the idea the caption the production the environment the final output and also the ID of the video And

45:40

then the good thing about this is for example these long URLs which you know you might want to chop up or edit before

45:46

you post those long URLs they're captured inside a spreadsheet which is great because then

45:52

when you need to come back to this or if you need to share this with your team etc you can just use this nice little

45:58

spreadsheet and also it just counts up how many automations you've run as you can see Okay so what you can see for

46:05

example here is that it maps out in the settings the caption the idea the

46:11

environment etc and it maps that to a Google sheet So if we check this out we've set up an idea to sheet Google

46:18

sheet within a document I've actually created this template that you can steal from me It's inside the AR profit boardroom So you can just grab that

46:24

Google sheet template if you want And inside here we've got the ID and usually

46:31

I just set that as like equals row brackets minus one so that it captures and counts each row We've got the

46:37

caption which is pretty easy to generate with Bigfoot's Wild Adventures The production so like that's the actual

46:42

status is it ready to be produced or not And then the environment the production bit here is quite interesting because

46:48

actually when it comes to auto posting to any sort of social media platform that production section right there

46:54

allows you to say this is ready to publish and then your automation later can pick it up and filter those out

47:00

Right we have now generated the idea plugged that into a spreadsheet Next up

47:05

what we need to do is start generating the video prompts based on the ideas Right So you can see here we've got an AI agent that takes the caption the ID

47:12

in the environment and then plugs it into a prompt So we've said create a VO3 prompt based on this and it's taking the

47:19

dynamic JSON ID and then we've said this is the environment and basically it's

47:25

taking the environment right so when you're generating a video this is really good because you're taking not just the

47:32

idea of the video but you're also painting the scene in the background in terms of how it could be Right So for example could be Bigfoot on a mountain

47:38

in the middle of the ice age vlogging about drinking a cup of tea and how good

47:43

that is right Whatever And then inside here we've said in the prompt explain the situation and who's vlogging The

47:49

main reason for that is because Veo3 needs context over what it is etc And if you don't have context or enough context

47:55

your outputs won't be that great So you can see for example here it's created the output based on the idea So it said

48:02

"In the heart of a vibrant jungle thick greenery surrounds an unexpected creature a friendly Bigfoot His fairy

48:08

hands gripping a camera as he captures a moment like no weather blah blah blah." Okay And then also in this section we

48:15

have the system prompt So let me pull this up Inside the system prompt we said

48:20

"Right here's you're an AI agent Use this format We've got these details

48:26

prompt rules etc Here's what to do blah blah blah." Right Nice and easy So what that's going to do is it's going to take

48:33

the ideas plug it into Google Sheets create a prompt out of that and then we're going to send this over to Veo 3

48:38

using a powerful API which I'll show you in a second Right now inside the AI agent as well what I would recommend is

48:46

as you're going through each section test it out test out step by step So you can test each section And also like it

48:54

can be expensive to generate the outputs So for example with the API on Bayo3 it

48:59

can be quite expensive because it's brand new And so you just want to make sure that each time you generate an output you pin it right So for example

49:06

you can pin it like this Right click the module pin that and that will just allow you to keep the output so you can test

49:12

the next stage and the next stage right You're relaying the information between each module So let's move on to actually

## Using APIs for AI Video Generation

49:18

generating the videos Now you're 75% of the way in And this is the HTTP request

49:24

right And so using this what you can actually do is generate outputs from

49:30

foul.ai And there's actually quite a few different APIs that run with Vo3 but FA

49:36

I think is the easiest and also uses a bunch of other tools as well What you want to do first is make sure that you

49:43

top up your balance inside FA And then inside here if we have a look you've got

49:49

the Veo 3 API Now this actually just came out a few hours ago And the cool thing about this is it's unlike any

49:54

other AI video generation because it generates audio and it's super like

49:59

realistic It's crazy realistic right And so you can grab the API from here I've

50:06

actually just pre-programmed this with our Veo3 URL And then for the authentication we've selected generic

50:13

credential type header off And then you just want to set up your credentials Right So if we go on here and we edit

50:18

these you can see basically what we've done is we put authorization as the name So use authorization as the name and

50:24

then for the value what I've actually done is type in key space the API key of

50:30

foul Now if you want to get your API key from foul you just go to your account over here Then you're going to go to API

50:36

keys add a key Make sure that you save that and copy it because otherwise you'll lose it And from here you can

50:44

grab this API key You would again type in key space and then copy and paste

50:49

your API key into NA10 inside the value section All right that took me a little

50:55

while to figure out If you have any questions just ask me inside the AR profit board and I can help you out And then inside here as well we've selected

51:01

send body JSON using fields below and then I've mapped this out right If you don't get this right this can mess up as

51:08

well So you want to select JSON using fields below prompt and then you're grabbing the JSON output which is the

51:14

prompt from the AI agent right and the reason that you're selecting name is so that foul understands okay this is the

51:21

prompt to generate the content with now for example if we go back to Vea 3 over here we can actually look at our

51:27

previous requests and if you don't get this right like I didn't get it right the first couple of times as you can see

51:32

it totally messed up and we got these 422 errors right and the reason is because this wasn't set up with the JSON

51:39

So make sure that you set up this properly If you just want the template you can steal it from me And also you

## Batching and Cost Considerations

51:44

want to be careful with batching right So this is expensive to generate outputs with So I just go with one item per

51:51

batch and then batch interval 2,000 And that keeps things running nicely in the

51:57

background Okay With that process you can easily connect foul to Vea 3 I think it cost us about $3 to $4 to generate

52:05

each output Now what I want to say here is if you want a cheaper way to do it a

## Cheaper Alternatives for Video Generation

52:10

cheaper way to generate videos like this you can actually do that with another automation

52:15

inside the AI profit boardroom which is this one inside the classroom the NA10

52:21

viral reels workflow right This is a lot cheaper It's actually using something called Flux and Cling which are way

52:27

cheaper Before you start commenting in the video like it's too expensive to generate etc you can just grab the resources in the blueprint I know not

52:34

everyone's going to comment like that but I know some people will So if you want to use Ve 3 you can It's more

52:39

expensive If you want to use cling it's cheaper and I've shown you exactly how to do it Plus I've given you the template inside a profit boardroom where

52:46

you can just grab this stuff from me So once we've done that then we're going to

## Generating and Scheduling Video Outputs

52:52

go to here and we're good to go Again test each step You can see the output So

52:57

this is the response URL with all the details right here And if we X off that

53:02

we've now scheduled got the idea sent it to Google Sheets created the prompt posted

53:09

it to foul.ai to generate the video And then the next module here is a wait

53:14

module Now you typically takes about I would say 3 to 4 minutes to generate outputs from Vo3 So I've selected the

## Connecting and Testing the Workflow

53:22

weight amount as 250 seconds And then what that's going to do

53:28

is wait before it tries to get the HTTP request directly from foul over here So

53:34

for example what this is doing with a get method for a HTTP request is it's

53:40

grabbing the URL plus the JSON request from the output Right So basically it's

53:46

just taking this unique ID number from foul when we generated the video inside beta 3 plugging it onto the end of the

53:54

foul URL and then again we've used the same credentials inside here and that's

53:59

pretty much it It's as simple as that when it comes to getting the output So you can see for example we've got the

54:05

video URL on the right hand side If we open this up on a new tab let's check this out So this is the video that we've

54:13

generated and that is good to go my friends All right there you got the content type

54:20

file name blah blah blah So that's pretty cool It's a really easy workflow really easy automation You can see how

54:26

it works step by step And then the final stage is we want to capture that information as well So for example we've

## Capturing and Storing Video Information

54:33

got stage four video to sheets here URL to sheets and then inside here we've just plugged that back into our Google

54:40

sheet Now the way that we've set up this module is we've set this up so that it's got the credentials sheets within

54:47

document and the operation here is update row So it goes into that NA10

54:52

video sheet template that we've talked about looks at the first tab and then we mapped it manually Right So we said take

54:58

the idea match the idea from previous which you can see right here

55:05

And then once you've done that and mapped it out inside the final output over here plug in the video URL which

55:12

you can see on the right hand side over here So we've generated three different videos using this process This is actually an old one with cling If you

## Comparing Output Quality: Cling vs. VE O Three

55:19

have a look at cling let's pull this up So cling's output is okay but it's only

55:26

going to give you like music in the background It's not going to give you dialogue right Whereas for example if we have a look at these two outputs from

55:32

the NA10 VO3 automation Check it out folks Totally organic wild squirrel

55:38

smoothie straight from my backyard Right So let's have a look at this one

55:43

Let's go full screen on this bad boy Can you believe this They're actually

55:49

dancing All right So that was Bigfoot dancing with monkey And that idea was

55:55

Bigfoot accidentally streams his dance off with monkeys Here's a caption Here's

56:00

environment And then we're good to go And then this one is the squirrel smoothie example That's the video URL

56:08

And then I've already shown you that so I'm not going to play it again but you get the point Really easy to generate these videos Really didn't take a long time to

56:15

to set up to be honest with you And then also you can just import the workflow from me So if you go into the AI profit

## Importing and Setting Up Workflows

56:23

boardroom it's quite easy to set this up For example if we go inside here we'll

56:28

download the VR3 automation Then you can just go to plus

56:35

workflow personal Then from here you're going to go to import from

56:41

file downloads Download that Boom Shack lacera You've got that imported Right

56:48

Beautiful And then you can just plug in the details as I've shown you today Right Really simple and easy to do And

56:54

you can also steal the spreadsheet from me That's inside the AR profit bordm Just go to the veil3 automation section

57:00

It's got the Google sheet the API details the example Tik Tok account and also if you want to learn how to post

57:06

this stuff directly to social media as well What we've actually got here is an

## Auto Posting to Social Media

57:11

auto poster NAM workflow which takes the URLs from the spreadsheet plugs it through Blow Blow can plug that into Tik

57:19

Tok automatically or any sort of other platform as you can see right here So Instagram YouTube Tik Tok Facebook

57:25

Twitter etc You can do all of this inside this automation And the automation to import

57:32

is this one right here All right super simple and easy to set up So thanks so

57:37

much for watching If you want to get all of this stuff feel free to get it inside the AI profit boardroom Link in the

57:42

comments description Comes with tons of other AI agents and workflows You can see all this all these different courses

57:48

that we've got right here Each of them has different modules and all sorts of crazy stuff And then inside the

## Community Support and Coaching Calls

57:54

community here we're super active We make sure we answer your questions You get help whenever you need it For example Jake commented on this and we

58:01

got back to him ASAP Everyone helping him out And then also we do three weekly

58:06

live coaching calls So if you join today you get three coaching calls per week And if you can't make them you can

58:11

actually watch them back inside the Q&A call recording section over here And additionally inside here what we

58:18

actually do once per week is we create automations based on what you want to see Right So if you want to see

58:23

something just let us know what you want to see and we'll create the automations for you So for example you can see here

58:29

we got 3 36 people commented on this thread for automations they wanted and

58:34

we just built them all out in a personalized video as you can see right here So feel free to get that link in the comments description Massive value

58:41

right there if you want to save time make more money and scale with AI And additionally if you want us to just

58:46

automate all of this stuff for you feel free to get a free AI strategy session

58:51

link in the comments description Basically you can jump on that call book it in And what we can do on that call is

58:56

essentially look at your business look at where you're spending all your time audit and then explain exactly what you

59:02

need to automate And if you want us to do it for you we can directly So feel free to book that in link in the comments description Appreciate you

59:08

watching Tyler's asking "How do you continue the same video into a scene with continuity?" I don't think you can

## Continuity in Video Scenes

59:14

actually unless you're using cling If you use cling then you probably could but typically you can't But if you use something like Bigfoot for example

59:21

Bigfoot is quite like it's a universal character right So it's going to use it's going to look very similar and

59:26

speak very similar each time But right now I think the best way to do that is probably with hen If you've got a hen

59:32

avatar then you can just use that over and over again and you get the continuity But Veo 3 I don't think it's

59:37

very good for continuity to be honest from what I've seen New NA10 slack agent want your own customizable AI assistant

## Building a Customizable AI Assistant in Slack

59:44

right inside Slack I'm going to show you exactly how to build this and connect it using NA10 and it's way easier than you

59:50

think Plus I'll give you the free downloadable template and I'll walk you through the entire setup process step by

59:55

step Plus you'll get my free template link in the comments description and you'll discover how to connect NAN to

1:00:01

Slack in just minutes You'll learn the exact API settings I'm using and how simple it is Today I'm going to show you how to link Slack to NA10 so that you

1:00:10

can basically have your own AI agent directly inside Slack and then you can customize it exactly how you want So

1:00:16

I'll show you exactly how to set this up Plus you're going to get the free template inside the AI success lab link

1:00:21

in the comments description And so you can see Slack is connected over here If you go to our Slack channel you can see

1:00:27

it says here hey automated with this NATM workflow And then it links directly

1:00:32

to our NAT workflow that automated this process right This is really easy to set up once you figure out Okay so let me

## Setting Up Slack Automation with n8n

1:00:40

show you exactly how to set this up step by step and the whole process So if we have a look at this particular AI agent

1:00:47

what we've done over here is we've selected a post message node Now if you're wondering how to do that you just

1:00:53

add a node You're going to type in Slack and then from here we're going to select

1:00:58

actions and we're going to click on send a message Right So inside my settings

1:01:05

for the Slack automation I've set up a direct login So the way that you can do that is you can just go to the dropown

1:01:13

over here create new credential and then you can actually log in with Slack directly Then in the resource section

1:01:20

you can select message operation equals send You can select a channel over here

1:01:26

And then you can choose which channel you want to post in Right So for example let's say from the list inside the

1:01:32

message type we've just selected send message and then you can put whatever message you want So for example right

1:01:39

now I'll come on to what you would send in a second But what you want to do whilst setting this up is you want to go

1:01:46

to api.slack.com right Then you're going to go to create new app like you can see

1:01:54

and then from scratch right So let's say for example we want to put SEO bot as

1:02:00

the app that we want to build and we're going to build that inside our space over here So we're going to create the app like and now once you set up this

## Creating a Slack Bot and API Integration

1:02:07

SEO bot you're going to see a page that looks like this Okay So what we need to

1:02:13

do from here is we need to go to Oorth permissions Then we're going to scroll

1:02:18

down So scroll down the page and then inside scopes you're going to add a few

1:02:25

different settings right So for example for my example the scopes that we added

1:02:31

previously apps mentions channels colon join channels chat groups right and this

1:02:37

basically just allows the agent to interact directly inside your Slack So

1:02:44

you can just select the options that you want as you can see right here If you want to steal these settings from me

1:02:49

I'll put it inside the AI success lab inside here So you go to

1:02:55

API.slack.apps go down to permissions use the settings below And I've

1:03:01

screenshotted them for you right here Now if we go inside our Slack channel like you can see we're just going to tag

1:03:08

in And before we do that we need to select off tokens and install to

1:03:13

unlimited goldie agency So you go to permissions then you go to install to

1:03:18

your Slack channel So we're going to click on that and we'll install this app to our channel As you can see Dev Ryan

1:03:27

says "Thank you God bless you." Thank you and thanks for watching Appreciate you And now we've got this set up We're

1:03:34

all good to go on that All right Now if we go back to our Slack channel so you can see I'm inside my Slack here We can

## Testing and Finalizing the Slack Bot

1:03:41

press app and we are going to type in SEO and SEO bot All right as

1:03:50

you can see now what you'll see is that we have to add the Slack bot to the

1:03:55

channel All right so we're going to add them like we've invited the SEO bot to the channel and now it's been added

1:04:01

Happy days Now if we test this operation so you can see we've tested the send

1:04:06

message with the message text hey You can see that we've posted a message from

1:04:11

NAN directly to Slack Happy days Now

1:04:16

what we're going to do is we're going to set up a trigger So we're going to delete that and we're going to select

1:04:22

new trigger And this is going to allow us to monitor any times the bot

1:04:28

has been mentioned Right So this bot on NA10 monitor any mentions of it inside

1:04:36

Slack And if it receives a mention then it's going to reply that to us So we got the Slack account bot app mention We can

1:04:44

select watch the whole workspace if we want to as well And then what you're going to see is a web hook So you're going to take that web hook URL Just

1:04:50

click it to copy it You're going to go over to your API settings So we got the SEO

1:04:58

bot app here We're going to go down to events So you can see event subscriptions enable events and then

1:05:05

we're going to paste in that web hook We just need to click test inside our Slack trigger So let's click test So that's

1:05:12

going to listen out We're now going to retry And that's been verified Right So

1:05:20

we've verified and link the web hook URL Now what we need to do is click add bot user event and we can select an event

1:05:27

that triggers the automation So as an example we've selected app

1:05:33

mention inside the NA10 example that I built previously Select app mention inside yours for example as well So here

1:05:41

we go Then we'll hit save changes and that saves the event of the agent being

1:05:48

mentioned right So it's linked to our workflow So if we go back to our channel now and we mention our SEO bot you can

1:05:56

see that's now filled in the mention of the bot and selected it as an event

## Advanced Slack Bot Features and Customization

1:06:03

Beautiful Now what we need to do in between the Slack trigger and the Slack

1:06:08

post message is to add an AI agent So we're going to add a new module Click

1:06:14

the plus sign Click AI agent Connected to the chat trigger mode We can add some

1:06:20

system message So we'll put you are a helpful assistant We'll take the text from the previous module So you can see

1:06:26

it's taking the text from here plugging it into our AI agent It's a helpful assistant And if we go back now all we

1:06:34

need to do is just add a chat model All right So I'm going to select OpenAI You can use Open Routter if you don't want

1:06:39

to pay for APIs So either way you can connect OpenAI to your AI agent We're

1:06:45

going to link that AI agent over to Slack over here Right So let's just test

1:06:51

this out That's got the information from the previous module and passed it and

1:06:57

relayed it over here All right And the output is hello how can I assist you today Now what you can also do is add a

## Connecting Slack to AI Agents

1:07:04

memory in here And then inside our Slack message here inside the message text

1:07:10

we're going to delete that and we're going to take the output from the AI agent Right So basically when the AI

1:07:16

agent responds it's going to be taking the output and plugging it back into Slack

1:07:22

So let's test that step This is the Slack channel that we've created We're

1:07:29

going to hit test step like and you can see it says hello How can I assist you today And that is using the NA10

1:07:35

workflow Beautiful So that's basically how we've connected Slack as an AI agent

1:07:41

in a really simplistic way If you want to steal the template from me I've actually included the slack template

1:07:48

inside the AI success lab But essentially it's pretty simple and easy to do If you want to get the settings

1:07:54

for each part let me show you exactly how So I'll plug that into the AI success lab with all the screenshots And

1:08:01

what I'll also do is inside the AI success lab I'll include SAP step by step on exactly how to install this

1:08:06

stuff as well from the transcript today So that's essentially it That's how you

1:08:12

can connect Slack Now if you wanted this to go live for example what you would actually do is you would make this

1:08:18

active as you can see And then if we go back into the Slack trigger we can now

1:08:24

get the production URL All right we're going to go back over to Slack in the API settings over here And inside the

1:08:32

event we're going to change the web hook to this one instead because that's the live web hook Yeah Right We'll hit save

1:08:39

changes Let's test this out And now you can see as soon as I posted that message

1:08:44

it's replied to me instantly Now if you wanted to make this AI agent more useful what you could actually do inside the

1:08:50

system message here is you could actually just change this So for example you could say you're an SEO expert write

1:08:57

in SEO content the keyword you write the article All right

1:09:04

just as an example random example So we're going to make this active again Then we'll go back to ads and we'll plug

1:09:11

this in So we're going to tag in the SEO bot and say keyword equals SEO training Japan And now you can see that it will

1:09:18

respond to us talking about the SEO keyword that we want to write about and the content etc So if we go inside here

1:09:26

and we say write an article about SEO training Japan and we just

1:09:32

make sure we tag in the SEO bot There you go You've got the article written in

1:09:37

markdown format Created the whole thing It's written it down in Markdown So if we for example take this content now

1:09:44

we'll go over to markdown live preview Check the content from the SEO bot we just created and we've got a full

1:09:50

article written and ready to go Obviously you would tweak the prompts This was just a test but you can see how

1:09:55

easy it is to build your own bot inside Slack link it to NA10 and then whatever you want to automate or whatever you

1:10:02

need help with you can easily have AI integrated directly inside there NA10 as

1:10:07

well it does have a Discord feature So you can do the same thing inside Discord But essentially that's how it works step

1:10:13

by step So you can easily see how to build Slack bots how to create them how to set them up inside any 10 If you want

## Importing and Customizing Slack Templates

1:10:19

the template go to the AI success lab It's got all my settings plus a step-by-step tutorial on how to build

1:10:26

all this stuff what settings to use and if you just want to import the Slack template you can actually download it here And then if we for example created

1:10:33

a new workflow inside NA10 we can upload the JSON file that we

1:10:38

just created for Slack AI agent just imported automatically and you just

1:10:44

customize it based on the settings for your own app right But you know exactly how to do that today Now if you need help setting this up if you want all my

1:10:50

best automations and if you want to make more money with AI and basically automate and save time you can see how

1:10:56

much time you would save with that one single app then feel free to get the AI profit boardroom Comes with tons of

it's confusing us more than helping us my friend I totally get it SEO can be

1:13:19

overwhelming at first What if we focus on defining clear achievable goals for your SEO strategy So you get the point

1:13:26

Easy to automate And this is all based on the custom criteria that we put inside this report It can work for you

1:13:32

whether you're doing outbound calls for appointment setting whether you're doing outbound calls for example for let's say

1:13:38

you are trying to get clients in or let's say you've even got a call funnel where you just need to reach out to

1:13:44

leads and that sort of thing This is quite easy to set up Pretty simple automation If you actually just want to skip ahead and just steal it from me

1:13:50

then you can get it from the AI success lab which is completely free Let me pull

1:13:55

that up for you as an example So if we go to the AI success lab link in the comments description go to the classroom

1:14:01

AI course and then boom we have the NA10 appointment setup and you can just

1:14:06

download the resources directly from me All right so let me show you exactly how this works step by step and exactly how

1:14:12

to set it up Right So first thing that you want is to have a schedule right So you can see here for example every day

## Scheduling and Managing Appointments

1:14:20

9:00 a.m we can schedule this workflow to run And what it's going to do is check my calendar So it's going to run

1:14:25

through my calendar over here It's going to say "Right over the next sort of 24 hours what have we got going on Who are

1:14:32

we going to need to contact?" So for example we got Julian Gold's NA10 party He's booked in a call Let's call him So

1:14:38

it's going to take all the calendar information and plug it in So in terms of the settings here if we pull this up

1:14:45

we've got days between triggers one day trigger hour 9:00 a.m trigger minute

1:14:50

Don't worry about that And that is just a schedule for a trigger So the first thing you want to do is just add a node

1:14:58

Right click here add node and then just a schedule trigger That's the one you're

1:15:04

going to select And then use these settings like so If you want to steal these settings from me what I can

1:15:09

actually do is just screenshot those and plug them into the AI success lab So you

1:15:15

can get the details completely for free Right You don't need to pay for this It's completely free You can just steal

1:15:21

the schedule trigger settings from me down here Right folks now the other thing you can do as

1:15:28

well is you can actually use your 11labs

1:15:33

custommade provoice as well So if you want your voice to be more lifelike then all you do is you use 11 Labs create a

1:15:39

custom voice using the pro package and then your voice can be exactly like a clone of yours pretty much Now John asks

1:15:47

"Did you set your schedule by your timing or the key customer country?" So this is just based on our timing You can

1:15:53

do it however you want You could set up a trigger based on the country and that sort of thing as well So now what we've

1:15:59

done is we've set up this appointments trigger All right So you can see here for new appointments Basically what

1:16:05

we're doing is we're taking the daily schedule and the details of the appointment and then we're saying right after now and before 24 hours later get

1:16:13

all the calendar invites from this particular list right from this email

1:16:18

address And so it's logging in with my Google calendar It's quite easy to add a credential You just click on create new

1:16:24

credential and then sign in with Google And then using this you can easily just log in with your Google set up a

1:16:31

resource get the latest calendar appointments from your calendar That's going to say "Okay within the next

1:16:37

24-hour window let's get all the calendar appointments like you see over here." And then we can use those to plug

1:16:43

them into our NAN agent All right So if we were setting this up from scratch

1:16:49

you're going to add a node with the details of the daily schedule then you're going to

1:16:56

add a new node called get appointments All right So to do that you can just

1:17:03

click the plus sign over here You would add a schedule trigger using that And

1:17:08

then after that you're going to link that to a calendar invite right You select Google calendar and then get many

1:17:14

events And then you're good to go on that as well right We'll just delete that for now but you see the point And then if you want the settings for this

1:17:20

let me pull that up for you And we can plug that into the AI success lab as

1:17:26

well All right So if you want to steal these from me Also one thing to note here is we've selected return all So

1:17:32

that returns all the appointments in the calendar for that specific window And for all the settings I'll put these

1:17:38

inside the AI success lab Just go to the NA10 appointment setter 2.0 and then you can get the details The reason it's

1:17:44

called 2.0 is because I did previously set this up a few days ago but I honestly I didn't like the prompts that

1:17:50

much I didn't think it was that good Whereas now I actually think the prompts are 10 times better and the resources

1:17:55

and the results you get from this are a lot better than they've ever been All right so from here we've set up the

1:18:00

daily schedule We've set up the appointment collector Then that's going to go to this AI agent Okay And

1:18:06

essentially inside this AI agent we've got this prompt which basically takes

1:18:12

the information from the appointment So for example it's collecting the event name the date and time the time zone and

1:18:19

the description And then it's saying here's what you're going to do when you connect Be patient slow down wait for

1:18:24

the appointment details etc So that's the user message that we use We selected define below as the AI agent plugged in

1:18:30

this prompt and then require specific format Right So basically what that's going to do is allow you to connect a

1:18:36

parser to the AI agent that takes all the information from here and then organizes it neatly I'll show you how to

1:18:42

set that up in a second All right And then from here we also have a system message So we have this system message

1:18:48

that basically says like you are Julian Goldai the world's best appointment setter Call the leader who's already booked in a call from Julian Gold's

1:18:54

calendar Confirm that they can attend at the scheduled time Here's what to do Blah blah blah All right If you want the

1:19:00

full details and want to copy and paste for that let me put the system message inside here So that's for the NA10 agent

1:19:09

and you got the prompt message and the system message that you can just copy and paste for me Now by the way if you

1:19:16

just want the template that you can just copy and paste and literally just import then we have the appointment setter agent template down here inside the AI

1:19:24

success lab So you can just download this stuff from me All right the other thing to note here is when you're doing

1:19:32

this if you want like support if you want help if you want implementation support etc then feel free to get that

1:19:38

inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description This just comes with like weekly coaching calls awesome

1:19:44

community all my best AI agents plus DM support So if you need help implementing this stuff if you get confused along the

1:19:50

way just join the AR profit boardroom and then you can get the help and the support you need All right So what we're

## Configuring Outbound AI Agents

1:19:56

going to do from here is we'll set up the outbound AI agent I've shown you all the settings for this I'm just going to

1:20:01

grab that and copy it for you as well And then you just want to link this to an OpenAI chat model I actually use GPT4

1:20:09

Mini with my OpenAI account You could use even Open Router or something like that If you just want to use this for free then you can use Open Routter Plug

1:20:16

that in change your settings and you're good to go But basically the main thing here is like you're creating an outbound agent that passes the information from

1:20:22

the calendar event and sends it over to this structured output passer Right So to set this up like I said you want to

1:20:29

make sure that you select require specific output format and then from here select structured output parser and

1:20:36

then for the schema type select define below Right Don't select generate from JSON example select define from below

1:20:44

From here you've got all this information in terms of what's going to be sent over to the AI agent for booking

1:20:50

Now you can see here for example we are passing the information into the

1:20:56

properties event name date time zone about contact phone number address decision maker etc Basically what we're

1:21:02

doing here is we're going to collect the data from the appointment and we're going to fire that over to our agent

1:21:10

that does the outbound dials in a minute I'll show you how to set that up in a second as well Right So if you want the

1:21:16

outbound passer details to copy paste you've got them all right here Now just

1:21:22

to recap you set up the daily schedule trigger so the automation runs at 9:00

1:21:28

a.m every day and it looks at the appointments over the next 24 hours Then this gets all the information from your

1:21:34

calendar and it sends it over to the AI agent which is going to pass that information so that we can put it in a

1:21:39

structured format for outbound dials Now we're on to the final module right Pretty simple stuff So on the final

## Using Tel AI for Outbound Calls

1:21:46

module what you're going to be doing is using a tool called retelli.com and retail is basically

1:21:53

automated outbound voice dialer right It's a voice agent and you can connect it to NA10 and it's pretty simple and

1:21:59

easy to set up For example what you want to do is you want to go into retailai.com You can get a free trial

1:22:06

and they'll give you $10 free credits And essentially you're going to create an AI agent The one that I used to set

1:22:13

up is a single prompt agent So just select create agent and then single

1:22:18

prompt agent in the top right Once you've done that you're going to see an example like this I've selected GPT40

1:22:24

mini realtime to get faster responses on the call This is more expensive than

1:22:30

using something like cheapy 4.1 which is a lot slower but also cheaper So it

1:22:35

depends Do you want speed or better quality Right That's up to you Do you want to go cheap or do you want to go fast You can't really do both And so

1:22:42

what we've done here is we've plugged in this prompt into our single prompt AI

1:22:47

agent If you want the instructions I'll put it inside the AI success lab But basically you click this link and then

1:22:53

plug in this details into a single prompt as ideally you want to use o mini

1:23:02

real time Once you've done that you also want to load a knowledge base What I

1:23:07

actually did was I uploaded a document of our sales SAP and our outbound selling SAP that can train the agent on

1:23:14

exactly what to say on the call We do it because we want to make sure that the agent knows what type of questions to

1:23:21

ask and what our process is on getting those calls confirmed And bear in mind

1:23:26

like this is a massive win If you're running Facebook ads if you're running any sort of booking appointment funnel which I know a lot of you guys are out

1:23:32

there and girls right Then this is an easy way to reconfirm the bookings make sure they actually show up qualify them

1:23:39

and even get the call recordings so that you can make sure you know these are qualified leads and you can get warmed up You can also get the details of the

1:23:45

call from your AI agent and then with that transcript and the notes you're more warmed up and you're more ready for

1:23:51

the call because the discovery processor has already been done inside the sales process So just to be clear here we've

1:23:58

set up the knowledge base In terms of the functions you just want to make sure you add end call as a function there

1:24:03

Then you've got the knowledge base set up Speech settings These are the speech settings I just went with the default

1:24:09

ones Call settings These are the call settings I've set up And it's important to put inside the

1:24:16

instructions here like just be patient and wait to connect And also only ask one question at a time This is important

1:24:22

too because otherwise what it does is it blasts like 10 questions to your client as soon as they answer the call which

1:24:27

you don't want Right now the other thing to note here is when you're doing this if you're going to call them with AI as

1:24:34

far as I'm aware due to compliance you need to be careful Right So you need to make sure you have a disclaimer if

1:24:40

you're going to call anyone with AI before they opt in and book the appointment That's for compliance

1:24:45

reasons Now I'm not a legal expert so I'm not going to tell you exactly what to do or how to do it You can always check with a legal expert but as far as

1:24:51

I'm aware that's what I know So just make sure you do your own research before you test this out So from here

1:24:57

what you also want to do is select from the welcome message dropown with a dynamic begin message So that's going to

1:25:03

take the information from the call which we've passed inside here So it's got the

1:25:09

details of the event name who's going to be attending the email address etc And then it's going to personalize the

1:25:15

information to that person Right And the good thing about this is faster than

1:25:20

human appointment setter and it's easier to set up Honestly it is way faster to train this AI agent to do outbound calls

1:25:27

for you than it is to train an appointment set I can tell you that for free All right So we've run through all

1:25:32

the settings right here And then you just want to click on publish So you can see an example here And select an

1:25:38

outbound phone number So you can see we can select our outbound phone number here Right now now when you're setting

1:25:44

this up you also want to make sure inside the phone number section here you add a new phone number So you can click on buy a new number You can buy it for

1:25:50

$2 You get $10 of free credits So it's basically free And then you just need to

1:25:56

verify it which you'll see the top settings in the right Right see verify on your mobile phone Take a picture of

1:26:01

your ID It verifies in about 60 seconds from my own experience And then you're going to assign that outbound agent to

1:26:09

the information So these are my settings for the phone number All right So we've got the outbound call agent That's

1:26:15

taking the agent from our agent section over here as you can see And then inside

1:26:21

the phone number section as well That's basically it right We didn't select inbound call agent or anything like that

1:26:27

Actually disabled the inbound But you can see how easy it is to set that up If you need the settings let me grab the

1:26:33

settings for you and I'll plug that inside the AI success lab And by the way I'm not the genius to set this up I

1:26:40

learned this stuff from AI workshop on YouTube Would recommend checking out his channel He's very good at NA10 workflows

1:26:47

So from here we've got the agent set up We've got the phone number set up The thing that we also need to do is create

1:26:52

the API key So you need to grab an API key like you can see And then we're going to plug that into NA10 in a second

1:26:59

All right So just to be clear here inside Retail AI you've created the agent you've set up the phone number and

1:27:06

you've also set up the API key And from there you're good to go So once you've done all of this then what you're going

1:27:13

to do is go back to NAT and you're going to select HTTPS request You're going to add a node

1:27:21

that says HTTP request And then the method is going to be post That is the

1:27:28

method because you're posting outbound I'm just going to delete that Right So you can see this is our HTTP request

1:27:34

module And inside here we've got the outbound dial section So what we're doing is we're taking the information

1:27:40

from the AI agent So for example the phone number the time zone what the

1:27:45

appointment is about the contact phone number etc Then we've got this URL as

1:27:51

the URL Okay So if you need that URL let me plug that in right here So that's the

1:27:57

URL you're going to plug in And then in terms of the generic credential type select custom

1:28:04

off custom off account and then you're going to take your API key and plug it inside JSON code like this So this is an

1:28:13

example right So you got the headers the authorization the content type and you just put your API key in this section

1:28:20

right here All right Obviously I'm going to delete my API key after this video but I just want to show you exactly how

1:28:25

it's set up to help you and that's why I'm exposing it to everyone on the video right now Then from here you're going to

1:28:30

scroll down once you've set up the custom or account and you're going to select sendbody JSON using JSON and then

1:28:37

you're going to take this JSON information like now This is the dynamic information from the appointment

1:28:43

information right here that's been passed So you can see an example right here If you want to take that code from

1:28:48

me let me show you exactly how to do it So this is the JSON body on the HTTP

1:28:53

request as an example You can customize this as much as you want You can also

1:28:58

take this information and just ask chat GBT like what's the best way to format it or I want to add this field or that

1:29:04

field etc if you want to customize the JSON without actually being a coder right But basically what we're doing

1:29:09

here is we're taking the phone number from retail A and we're plugging that inside the JSON Right To get the phone

1:29:16

number you just go to phone numbers over here You're going to find that phone number you created and then just copy it and plug it into your settings like you

1:29:23

can see The two number is going to be the number from the calendar event which is right down there and it's dynamic The

1:29:30

name is going to be the event name that you can see from the calendar event Same for the phone number the reason start

1:29:37

time That's all taken from the event And then the final thing here is that you need to get the agent ID Now if you want

1:29:43

to get the agent ID you just go back to agents Then you're going to click on single prompt agent And then from here

1:29:49

you're going to copy this agent ID in the top left That allows you to grab the

1:29:55

agent ID and then plug it inside the JSON file like you can see over here So

1:30:00

once you've done that you are good to go my friends That was basically it You

1:30:06

selected the URL the authentication added the custom authentication sent the body JSON using JSON plugged in the JSON

1:30:13

from the AI success lab and then you are good to go Now as you're running this workflow you want to test each section

## Testing and Verifying the Workflow

1:30:21

right So test a step make sure it works That's going to relay the information to the next step so that when you get to

1:30:26

the outbound dial section you're able to test it and make sure this works right So for example again if we go and we

1:30:33

test this step it's going to be a slight delay inside Google voice or where have

1:30:39

you taken the call Hey this is Julian Goldie's AI assistant I was just calling

1:30:44

about your call What's your biggest challenge with SEO right now Right now

1:30:49

mate we are struggling with building back links Building back links can definitely be a

1:30:56

challenge Just curious are you looking to improve your site's authority or are you focusing more on driving targeted

1:31:02

traffic Yeah right now we just want to get more targeted traffic to our website We're trying to rank for our certain

1:31:08

keywords Got it Targeted traffic is crucial for ranking When you're aiming to rank for

1:31:13

those specific keywords do you currently have a strategy for identifying highquality sites to get back links from

1:31:19

No we have no idea how to find them No worries A good approach is to start by

1:31:25

identifying websites that are already relevant to your industry or niche Have

1:31:30

you tried looking for sites that already rank for your target keywords or those that are considered authorities in your

1:31:35

field Not yet That's a great idea Building relationships with authoritative sites in your niche can

1:31:41

really boost your SEO You might start by reaching out to them for All right So

1:31:47

you see here how it's like actually quite a powerful automation where you're not just doing the discovery process

1:31:53

with the potential client and the customer but also you're giving value to the person they're calling up right

1:31:58

Because you can see this AI agent isly looking at the situation analyzing what

1:32:05

they can improve giving them tips on how to improve and then setting that process up so that when it comes to the actual

1:32:11

call that my team will take that client has already got value understands that

1:32:17

we're the experts is already impressed by the process and is now warmed up and ready and knows exactly what they need

1:32:22

to do to get more SEO traffic right And this would work for any agents or anyone running a sales call funnel So hope that

1:32:30

helps And I have downloaded that template and plugged it inside the free

1:32:36

AI success lab Like you can see right here you can get it for free I just

1:32:42

wanted to help you and that's why I'm giving you all this information All right It's absolutely amazing what you

1:32:48

can do with this It's amazing that NA10 can do it and you can see how easy it is to set up Now as I said I'm going to

1:32:54

have to just delete my API key So you can delete your API key like so Just

1:33:00

make sure you set up another one and set that as a web hook And then your API key is done and dusted my friend And that's

1:33:07

basically it And then if you want to import this stuff let me show you how easy it is So if we go into workflow

1:33:13

personal we're going to download the template from the AI success lab which you can see right here So this is the

1:33:20

JSON code We'll download that and then we'll go inside NA10 and we're going to go to import

1:33:26

from file upload the JSON Boom Shaka laka agent is just set up ready to go

1:33:33

Didn't cost you a penny because you can steal it from me inside the AI success lab All right so that's basically it

## Replicating n8n Workflows with Claude

1:34:21

replicate any NA10 AI agent in one click using Claude So you can see for example here we actually screenshotted the

1:34:27

workflow we wanted to replicate Then we created the JSON inside CLA I'll show you how in a second If we paste that

1:34:32

into NA10 you can see that has come out perfectly And today I'm going to show you exactly how to do it Now I just

1:34:38

discovered how to build NA10 AI agents in seconds using clause You can basically take a screenshot of any NA10

1:34:44

workflow I'm going to show you exactly how to build up a customuilt project like you can see right here So you'll

1:34:49

get basically awesome copypaste JSON that instantly creates the entire automation And in this video I'm going

1:34:55

to show you how to set up Claude with the customuilt instructions like you can see right here You'll learn the exact

1:35:02

prompt template that makes Claude an NA10 expert basically instantly You'll get all of this for free and I'll show

1:35:08

you how to replicate any workflow with just a screenshot even adding custom modules and you'll get the free resource

1:35:15

I created so you can steal this entire system from me So I'm going to show you how to basically get Claude to create

1:35:22

and copy almost any template you can find So basically what Claude can now do

1:35:28

using this process I'll show you is very specific and I'm going to show you step by step exactly how to set it up It can

1:35:33

now create agents like you can see right here that basically copy and paste and

1:35:38

then you can paste those directly into NA10 Right So as an example this is one I actually built earlier And if you want

1:35:44

to build this out yourself let me show you how So we'll just delete that And this agent is custom trained on NA10's

1:35:51

documentation to be able to build and copy paste NA10 templates Right So for

1:35:56

example I actually took a screenshot of this NA10 workflow that I wanted to replicate Then I said recreate this

1:36:03

workflow And if we copy this information right here and then paste it directly into NA10 you can see that it basically

1:36:10

creates a really simple workflow based on our screenshot Right So this was the original screenshot And this is the

1:36:17

whole workflow And you can see it's even added the same sticky notes inside the workflow So we can easily just copy

1:36:23

paste and replicate any NATM workflow using this custom trained clawed project

1:36:30

Here's another example So if we grab this one let's copy this And then you

1:36:35

can see this was one that you can easily build out And yeah it's a simple but powerful

1:36:42

workflow All right I want to show you another one as well So if we say for

1:36:49

example create a AI voice agent for

1:36:55

NA10 inside the NA10 JSON builder It's now going to start coding out right

1:37:01

So you can see it's thinking about it and it can basically produce like copy paste JSON code right So the way that

1:37:07

this works is we've actually got this custom trained prompt over here I'll put

1:37:13

it inside the AI success lab So you can get the prompt for free if you want to just steal this stuff from me But

1:37:20

basically we said you are an NA10 expert NA10 workflow generator Your job is to

1:37:26

create fully functional NA10 workflow JSON that can be directly pasted into NA10 to create working automations JSON

1:37:32

should be complete valid ready to use blah blah blah Then we've included instructions on how to do that what to set up etc The output format and the

1:37:39

goal that is directly inside the project details of this agent Right Now what you

1:37:45

can also see here is that we've attached information on the JSON cheat sheet for NA10 and also a

1:37:53

bunch of other NA10 templates that it can learn from Right The way that this works

1:37:59

is let's take for example this information right here Basically has documentation on exactly how to build

1:38:06

out AI agents Now I've attached that all inside the AI success lab So you can just upload this knowledge if you want

1:38:12

to Essentially to set this up if you want to create a new project inside Claude that can build stuff like this

1:38:18

you just click on projects in the left hand side then you're going to click on new project From here create

1:38:26

project and then from here you're going to name your project right So for example Claude NA10 assistant right Okay

1:38:34

we'll create that project Like then from here inside the project knowledge we're going to upload from a device and I'm

1:38:39

going to take that information that's inside the AI success lab and just upload that So what I also like to do is

1:38:45

just upload a few NA10 template projects So I've actually got some of those inside the AI success lab But if you

1:38:52

want to see an example of how I do it we can type in JSON here Scroll down get

1:38:58

the web scraper agent that I've previously done Grab the appointment setter agent upload those and we're good

1:39:04

to go All right Now if we go back inside here and let's say we want to replicate

1:39:10

this particular agent we can just take a screenshot of any N8 workflow that we

1:39:16

want to replicate Then we're going to go back into Claude and using the project and the project knowledge we set up

1:39:22

we'll paste in that screenshot and we'll say replicate this into a JSON format for

1:39:30

NAN Crypto White Hat just tipped $5 Thank you very much sir Appreciate that

1:39:37

And Nicholas says "This is scary Reminds me of malware." I think you're referring to the MCPS I showed earlier If that's

1:39:43

the case yeah just use that stuff at your own risk but you do need to be careful what you install I show this stuff as a guinea pig but obviously you

1:39:50

do need to be careful in terms of what you build how you build it what you install etc And that's down to you and what you want to do But I take the risk

1:39:57

for you Now we're going to wait for this to load And you can see it's basically building out the JSON format right Which

1:40:03

is pretty cool cuz then you can copy and paste this stuff directly into NAN So

1:40:08

waiting for that to load right now and then do is just copy and paste that in Right So for example this is the

1:40:15

original template we took a screenshot of As you can see inside Claude here's the screenshot And then if we go to

1:40:22

overview we'll leave without saving that We'll create a new workflow And then all we're going to do

1:40:28

is take this information like copy it paste in that information and boom

1:40:34

shakalaka we've got the AI agent fully replicated Right So we've got the outbound dial the structured output

1:40:41

passer the open AI chat That's you saw the original a second ago which is this

1:40:46

screenshot right here and this is the workflow automation that's created Right Nice and simple We could say as well if

1:40:54

we just want to add an extra option to that we could say okay add a Google Sheets node to this too So I can output

1:41:03

the agent workflows to sheets whatever And let's say you want to add an extra

1:41:09

module to your NA10 template but you don't want to add it manually You can get Claude to put out the JSON Now one

## Setting Up Claude AI for Automation

1:41:15

thing I want to say right here is this has worked beautifully this time around So you can see that automation is

1:41:20

actually is actually awesome like it looks really good I don't want to BS you though because sometimes it doesn't go

1:41:25

that well and if that's the case you just need to tidy up But what I will say is that typically it will give you the

1:41:31

8020 right So it'll give you like the 8020 of the format and then you just need to make a few changes before you

1:41:37

finally go live and test out But in terms of adding the modules setting it all up etc it is quite easy to set up

1:41:44

with this Claude AI assistant And if you're wondering how do you set up you create a new project You insert the

## Creating and Using Custom Instructions

1:41:50

custom instructions from the AI success lab You upload the knowledge inside the resources section as you can see down

1:41:56

here And then from there you are good to go with your NA10 agent And what I'd recommend is that you don't necessarily

1:42:04

describe what you want Instead what I'd recommend is that you actually take a screenshot of what you

1:42:10

want and then replicate it that way That seems to work a lot better right Because then it's got a visual understanding of

1:42:15

what you want right So if we have a look this is the new workflow from

## Building and Testing Workflows with Google Sheets

1:42:20

NA10 the claude assistant and then you can see here it's taken exactly the same

1:42:26

workflow but this time it's added the Google sheet module as we requested

1:42:31

right so we've just literally copied and pasted that in taken the Google sheet

1:42:36

section like you can see that's all plugged in ready to go and then we just need to map this out and connect it to a

1:42:43

Google sheet but essentially that's how you can set up the whole process really easy to just copy paste and

1:42:48

replicate almost anything that you want If we go back to NA10 over here All

1:42:54

right And then inside NA10 we're just going to go to templates and find like a template that we could

1:42:59

actually set up as an example Then we're going to take this template like we'll copy that image as you can see Then

1:43:07

we're going to go back to Claude start new chat inside the project

1:43:12

section So let's find the N10 assistant put that in and then we'll say recreate

1:43:18

this And literally I would say in about 60 seconds you're going to have your full JSON ready to go Now you might need

1:43:26

to say in your instructions as well just recreate this in JSON for NASA etc

1:43:32

That's essentially it Okay just going to go back to the original JSON builder So here we go in and then it's going

1:43:39

straight into JSON as you can see Right So it saves a lot of time automates

1:43:45

replicates copies and pastes for you And to be honest like what you could even do is you could link this to something like

1:43:52

the MCP browser agent So I've got browser MCP there I could go inside Claude like and I could say create that

1:43:58

JSON file inside the project section and then go to NA10 and paste it in as a new

1:44:04

workflow You could probably fully automate that if you wanted to I'm not going to do that in this video but I just want to give you some ideas of what

1:44:10

you could build etc So if we just copy this JSON format from

1:44:17

the JSON builder then we're going to go over to NA10 We'll paste that in And there we go Crazy thing as well is if

1:44:23

you actually compare them side by side So this is the original and this is the version that we created This version

1:44:29

actually looks a lot neater and nicer right Super neat super tidy It's got nice sticky notes there as well The

1:44:36

automation is fully linked together as well And it was so easy to build that just using this custom NA10 project

1:44:43

builder Now actually took me a few hours to figure this stuff out But essentially if you want to just steal it from me

1:44:50

take the custom instructions take the custom knowledge inside the AI success lab It is completely free Link in the

1:44:56

comments description and then you can just grab this stuff from me The other idea that I had as well was that what

1:45:01

you could actually do is you could go to NA10 JSON builder Like you can see you

1:45:07

can go to Claude projects then go to new project type in all the details you want

1:45:13

right And then we can actually take the official NA10 docs from GitHub and load

1:45:19

that as knowledge inside Claude right So if we click on the plus sign under project knowledge

1:45:25

over here then we'll click on link Hit the copy and pasteable GitHub URL Paste

1:45:34

that in there And then you can select which official documents from NA GitHub you want to custom train that project on

1:45:41

Right And then you're probably going to get even better outputs because you're using the official documentation from

1:45:46

NA10 to build out your copy and paste machine Right But either way you can now get your AI agents to build other AI

1:45:54

agents and replicate any NA10 workflow that you want in a copy and pasteable format And it's completely free It's

1:46:02

crazy So feel free to get all my notes inside the AI success lab if you want to

1:46:07

steal this stuff from me Again you really do need the knowledge so you need to download that Make sure you've got

1:46:12

that plugged in as well And that is free inside the AI success lab If you want support and help and you want an amazing

1:46:19

community of people all interested in scaling and growing their business with AI including using NA10 automations then

1:46:26

feel free to get the AI profit boardroom This is an awesome community where you get DM support you get weekly Q&A calls

1:46:32

you get a community you can post in and ask questions to And there's 584 serious entrepreneurs trying to

1:46:39

scale their business with AI So feel free to get that link in the comments and the description What I'm going to show you is a way to automate outbound

## Automating Outbound Calls with AI

1:46:48

calls right And you can basically get an AI agent to call your appointments or your sales leads or anything like that

1:46:53

automatically as soon as they opt in So here's an example right here This using NA10 is an amazing workflow Absolutely

1:47:00

beautiful And if we click on the outbound dial section we can just run a test call So let's test this out right

1:47:07

here We're going to click on test step That's going to execute the nose As you can see phone call type And then you can

1:47:14

see the phone call coming through here Let's answer that No worries at all Take your time I'm here whenever you're ready

1:47:20

If you need a moment to get settled that's absolutely fine Just let me know when you're ready to continue Hey how's

1:47:26

it going Hey I'm doing great Thanks for asking How about you I really appreciate you taking the time to chat today I just

1:47:32

wanted to quickly confirm that you're still good for your scheduled call with Julian Goldie Is that time still

1:47:38

convenient for you And is this the best number to reach you on for the call Also before we jump in I'd love to learn a

1:47:43

bit more about you and your business What's the main SEO or link building challenge you're hoping to solve right

1:47:49

now Yes So right now what we want to do is scale our business with SEO get more

1:47:55

organic traffic That's fantastic Scaling with SEO and boosting organic traffic is

1:48:00

definitely something we can help with Just to make sure we tailor the call to your needs could you share a bit more

1:48:05

about your current situation For example what's your main goal for the next three six months when it comes to SEO or

1:48:12

organic growth Are you the main decision maker for SEO investment Or is there anyone else involved in the process And

1:48:18

out of curiosity what would make this upcoming call a big win for you Is there a specific result or outcome you're

1:48:24

hoping for No rush take your time And if there is anything you All right so we're gonna end that call right there but you

1:48:30

get an example of exactly what we've done how we've done it etc So the way that we've done this creating this AI

1:48:37

agent that can basically call your sales appointments reconfirm them is really simple and easy right So what you can

## Integrating Google Calendar with AI Agents

1:48:44

see here is we have an NA10 automation It's completely free to get access to If

1:48:49

you go inside the AI success lab link in the comments description and then go to the NA10 outbound calls agent you'll

1:48:55

find the template that you can just import straight into NA10 right there But essentially what we're doing here is

1:49:01

we're taking appointments For example you can see this calendar is linked to

1:49:07

new appointments that come in Then from here we have an AI agent that basically

1:49:12

responds and figures out okay what to say etc And that sends the information over to a tool that can make outbound

1:49:19

calls Absolutely amazing And you can sync this to a sales calendar or it could be to appointments or it could be

1:49:25

whatever you want lead generation You have to be careful of course because if you're making calls with AI you want to make sure that it's all compliant I'm

1:49:32

not a legal expert This is not legal advice You can figure that stuff out and research it Do your own research But you

1:49:38

get the point This is how powerful it is and how it works right So for example the way that this works is it's taking

1:49:46

appointments So I'm going to just set this up in a new tab as a new automation just to show you how easy it is Right So

1:49:53

if we go inside NA10 you're then going to go to create workflow And then inside

1:49:59

NA10 from here what you're going to do is add a first step Now I would recommend that you have this running on

1:50:05

a schedule So it could be like okay 9:00 a.m each day we're going to run this

1:50:11

automatically based on my new appointments right from the day before Just reconfirm everyone make sure everyone's going to join the appointment

1:50:17

right Then from here what we can do is we're going to add a new section called calendar and we're going to select

1:50:24

inside here get many events Now with get many events

1:50:30

basically you just want to connect your Google calendar like you can see you just sign in it's pretty simple allow

1:50:35

access to NAN and then from here you can actually get access to your emails So

1:50:40

for example this random email address that I've used for the process and what this is going to do is it's going to

1:50:46

take appointments from this email address So here's an example calendar with appointments So you can see we've

1:50:52

got an NA10 party happening tomorrow within the next 24 hours It's going to take that information and send it over

1:50:59

to the AI agent Now the way that you can do this

1:51:04

is you're going to have the settings as Google calendar account resource and

1:51:10

then you can click on return all So just select return all toggle that on and

1:51:16

then from here we can just select okay anything after right now but before 24

1:51:22

hours time All right so we'll plug that in and basically what that's going to do is take all the appointments within the

1:51:28

next 24 hours So from here we can just test that step and basically what that's doing is

1:51:35

taking all the information from the appointment and sending it over here So

1:51:40

you can see this is all the information about the appointment when it's going to start when it's going to end etc So just

1:51:45

to recap here we've scheduled a trigger to run every 24 hours and then we've set up Google calendar to grab all the

1:51:52

latest events From here what we're going to do now is set up an AI agent So you can see we've got the outbound AI agent

1:51:59

The way that we set this up we just click on this and we need to link this to a model

1:52:07

Now you could use Open Router for free something like that I'm just going to use Open AAI because it's easier So I've

1:52:13

got this connected If you don't know how to connect this you just edit the credentials and plug in your API key from

1:52:18

OpenAI And then you're good to go All right So we've got schedule the trigger

1:52:23

Google calendar AI agent That's got the information right there And then you just need to program this AI agent to be

1:52:30

able to run your instructions So here's an example right So it's got the source

1:52:37

for the prompt We're going to select define below Right And then we're going to plug in a prompt as you can see right

1:52:44

here So pasted that in Now if we open this up what you can see is we are taking in the information from the event

1:52:51

the date the time and the description of the event Right And also you want to add some new instructions here So for

1:52:57

example wait be patient Might take a while to connect whatever And you just giving some information to the agent Now

1:53:02

I think honestly this could be improved but I just want to give you an example of how it works right And then if you

1:53:08

want to drag in the date and the time or or select random stuff from the account

1:53:13

you can just for example drag and drop this information that's been taken previously So what this is doing is taking the JSON information from the

1:53:20

Google calendar event and then telling the AI exactly what our appointment's about so that it can figure that stuff

1:53:26

out Okay Now also we've got a system message right So what we're going to do is click on require specific output

1:53:33

format We're going to add a system message like you can see So let's add that in Plug that in If you're wondering

1:53:41

what the system message is basically as you can see you're Julian Goldie AI the world's best appointment set Call the

1:53:47

lead has already booked in a call from Julian Goldie's calendar Confirm that they can attend the scheduled time Blah

1:53:52

blah blah Now one thing I'd actually change if it was me doing this again then I would highly recommend that you

1:53:59

actually change this So essentially it only asks like one question at a time

1:54:05

because if you don't do that the AI agent might talk too much It might ask too many questions etc It can get messy

1:54:11

I wouldn't recommend that So you can see it's got the output the notes all the information about the appointment etc So

1:54:18

we've configured that set up the specific output format We're good to go on that Now what we also need to do is

1:54:25

set up a structured output parser Right now the way that you do that inside your

1:54:30

workflow is you would go over here and then you're going to select output parser structured output parser and then

1:54:36

you just take the information from your appointment Now you can rewrite this inside chat GBT and ask it to rewrite

1:54:43

something unique based on the specific details that you take but this is just what I'm using for the JSON is it's

1:54:50

pretty easy to set set up and simple to do right And by the way all the instructions with the importable

1:54:55

template are inside the AI success lab You've got the agent prompt example here You've got the instructions for the

1:55:02

system message the structure output example as well So you can just copy and paste this stuff from me if you want to

1:55:08

steal it and then customize it to you your business your API keys etc So we've plugged that in now and basically what

1:55:14

this is doing is you can see it's taking the event name the date the time zone about contact etc

1:55:19

So we're good to go on that Now we're just going to test this Make sure it actually works Let's click test step and make sure it works If there's any errors

1:55:26

we can fix it And let's just double check this on the

1:55:32

structured output We just need to change this to define below All right So make sure you've selected in your structured

1:55:38

output passer define below So now we're just going to retest the AI agent It's good for you to see stuff like this to

1:55:44

know how to fix it Now it works Perfect Beautiful You can see the inputs the outputs etc Living the dream my friend

1:55:52

All right Now what we're going to do is we're just going to add a HTTP request

1:55:57

for the outbound dial All right So we're going to click on plus over here There

1:56:03

we go And then we're going to select the method as post because this is going out

1:56:08

right So if we look at this example of what's already working you're going to select post Then you're going to use

1:56:13

this URL right And at this point you might be wondering okay what is retailai.com Let me show you an example

## Setting Up Retail AI for Outbound Calls

1:56:21

So Retail AI is basically a way of automating your call operations with

1:56:28

voice AI right Really powerful tool Pretty cool easy to set up And let me

1:56:33

show you exactly how to use it So you got an example right here And what you

1:56:39

want to do is just create an agent So you go to create an agent Single prompt agent That's all you need Now inside

1:56:46

that single prompt agent here are the settings that I used So I pasted in the same prompt from the system message on

1:56:52

NA10 which you've got inside the AI success lab if you want to steal it from me And then so this is the system

1:56:59

message And then inside here we've got a welcome message right So you want to click on AI initiates AI begins with

1:57:07

dynamic begin message like you can see over here What I would also recommend is

1:57:12

that you set up a knowledge base for the agent as well So it's got for example

1:57:18

details of you your SAP and then you can also choose between what language you want So you can do this in multiple

1:57:23

languages It can even be multilingual As you can see if you get appointments in Spanish French whatever language you see

1:57:30

all the languages then you can have this as a multilingual agent I've selected Jason but there's a bunch of different

1:57:36

voices that you can use as AI agents here So you know female male different voices Some of them very flamboyant I'll

1:57:43

be honest with you but you get the point And then from here you've got different

1:57:49

APIs that you can use Now some of them are more expensive than others So for

1:57:54

example you see here Gemini 2.0 Flash is like 0.006 per minute right Super cheap

1:58:02

Whereas you got GPT40 Mini Real Time which is like 0.125 per minute right So

1:58:07

that's going to get pretty expensive So it's up to you what you use I was using GPT1 for my example We've got JSON right

1:58:13

there English Boom Right We're ready to go on that Now the next thing that you want to do is inside retail aai.com is

1:58:23

you're going to go down to API keys and just make sure you have an API key like

1:58:28

you can see right here And then additionally we just need to go to phone numbers Now you can buy a phone number

1:58:35

for free You actually get $10 when you sign up And it costs $2 for a phone number So I just bought a phone number

1:58:41

like you can see set up and we selected outbound call agent as a single prompt

1:58:46

agent we set up before Right You can see that right there Right So that's the outbound call agent This is the ID for

1:58:52

the phone number and we're good to go on that Right now you've plugged in your

1:58:58

URL inside the HTTP request And then what we're going to do

1:59:03

from here is we're going to select generic as the authentication credential

1:59:09

type And then from here we're going to select custom or and by the way if

1:59:15

you're wondering like am I the genius that figured all this stuff out No I learned from a amazing YouTube account

1:59:20

called AI workshop Would recommend checking out That's where I learned this stuff from It does a lot of awesome test

1:59:27

tutorials on NA10 but it's pretty easy to figure out and pick up even if you're not technical like I'm not technical at

1:59:33

all So from here what we're going to do is click on send body and then we're going to select using JSON and then

1:59:39

we're going to use this process right here which I'll explain in a second Right So what you can see if we pull

1:59:45

this up as an example is we basically have the from phone number right so

1:59:52

that's a phone number that is inside retail AI So if you're wondering how to get that you go to Retail AI make sure

1:59:58

you've bought the phone number that we talked about before go to phone numbers and then grab this phone number and put

2:00:04

it inside the quote marks As you can see for the two number that would be the contact phone number from the

2:00:10

appointment Right So you can see that's the contact phone number from the appointment We've put that inside the two number section Then for the retail

2:00:19

LLM dynamic variables we've got the event name and we've also got the phone

2:00:26

number etc And the final thing that you need to customize as well is also the agent details Right So this is the

2:00:32

override agent ID Now if you want to get that all you do is you go back to your agent as you can see right here Then

2:00:38

you're going to click on single prompt agent And from here you would just copy this code in the top right That's going

2:00:46

to give you a copy and pasteable agent ID that you paste inside the quote marks over here Right So you just that boom

2:00:52

and then if you want to run the phone call you just click on test step and it's really easy and simple to set up

2:00:59

Right So basically you get a bunch of ideas of what you can create how to

2:01:06

create it Just make sure you've set up send body JSON using JSON Plug that information right there If you want to

2:01:11

get the JSON from me you can get that inside the AI profit boardroom I've put the HTTPS request example inside the

2:01:18

instructions right there I will delete my API key after this But that's basically how you can do it Simple and

2:01:25

easy I would also recommend maybe you want to run this through whatever you want And also here inside the knowledge

2:01:31

base you can click on add new knowledge base and just plug in the information So

2:01:37

for example let's wait for that You can see here I've uploaded my sales SP for

2:01:42

the appointment selling agent who can just go off and figure stuff out right

2:01:48

So really simple and easy You can add knowledge and if you have an SP on how to do outbound calls like we do for our

2:01:54

setters then you can put that inside the knowledge base plus some information about you etc And that just helps make

2:02:01

the agent way better So you for example add web pages upload files add text So

2:02:06

we could go in here We could type in like julian.com and then you can see actually

2:02:11

is this really interesting So actually takes all the pages from julian.com and

2:02:16

which ones do you want to include inside the agent knowledge base Right So

2:02:23

we can just take the homepage hit save or the about me page etc Type in the details and we can autosync that So if

2:02:29

you make any changes to your website you can autos sync that every day Click on Julian Goldie website for example Hit

2:02:37

save And now that knowledge is going to be updated to the AI agent So when it makes outbound calls it's going to be

2:02:43

way smarter because it has more context right It's not just a generic AI agent You can also for example even take a

2:02:49

transcript of your best outbound calls upload that to the agent and then this can do it as well So it's absolutely

2:02:56

amazing what you can do Easy to set up a phone number The only thing with the phone number is like you can't make

2:03:01

outbound calls until this is fully verified which literally takes one minute but you have to open up your

2:03:07

phone app take a picture of your ID plug in your face etc and then it's all verified and then you can start doing

2:03:12

calls Right So you'll see a little button in the top right that says verify your call And then you've got the phone number you got the agent you got the

2:03:19

knowledge base etc All set up inside this bad boy And then you got the API key over here Just going to plug that

2:03:26

into NA10 like you can see and then you can easily make outbound calls right

2:03:31

automated as you could even set up a trigger where it's right as soon as this web hook comes in and that web hook is

2:03:38

an appointment from your calendar then as soon as that comes through then you

2:03:43

make the outbound dial right so it's like speed to lead is super fast and you can just call people as soon as they've booked in the appointment so let's test

2:03:51

that out again we'll take the appointment here's the full workflow again you can download it inside the AI

2:03:57

success lab which is completely free Just go to this section here It's called NA10 outbound calls agent like you can

2:04:04

see And then if we go inside NA10 we'll run a test here So we'll click on this

2:04:12

Just make sure as well if you want to test this out that you're testing each stage of the process Right So you have to test this then that then this then

2:04:18

that Right And each stage of the process has to work because it relays the information onto the next module So for

2:04:24

example if we click on this one then we're going to click on test step And there's always a little bit of a delay

2:04:30

before the outbound call comes in Obviously it's not like directly instant

2:04:36

There we go Call from of course after Hello No worries at all Take your time

2:04:43

I'm here whenever you're ready Just let me know when you're available to chat about your upcoming appointment with Julian Goldie Hello there Hi there

2:05:05

is Ready to go You can customize the agent a lot more You can make the prompts much better and smoother But

2:05:11

that was just a little demo to give you a little taster of how it works Right If you want the workflow you've got it attached inside the AI success lab Link

2:05:17

in the comments description I've given you the demo shown you how easy it is to link to your Google calendar You could

2:05:22

also have that as a web hook from your CRM as well To be honest I would recommend the CRM method because the

2:05:28

faster you get to those appointments the more likely they are to confirm and be impressed by your amazing workflows And

2:05:34

you can see the knowledgebased example I've included all the links inside the AI success lab And yeah that's basically

2:05:40

it Now if you also want other automations on like a scraper agent a

## Scraping Data with NA 10 and Appify

2:06:48

show you is an easy way to basically scrape anything with NAN So you can see

2:06:54

this is an example web scraper that we built And if you pull up this example right here you can actually see that

2:06:59

we've scraped 50 dentists And you can do this for free I'll show you how in a minute with all their details like the

2:07:08

phone numbers email addresses etc And then we've actually blasted that over to a Google sheet which you can see on this

2:07:15

example And here's an example of the data that we scraped directly from Google Maps Now it doesn't have to be

2:07:21

from Google Maps could be from like I think there's like thousands of platforms on the app that I'll show you in a second But essentially if you want

2:07:28

to quickly scrape data for

2:07:33

free and then plug it into a Google sheet automation like you can see you can easily do it with this web scraper

2:07:39

AI agent Now I've actually included the template for free inside the AI SEO success lab So you can get the scraper

2:07:45

agent directly inside the AI SEO success lab If you want to get free access to it just import the JSON as you can see down

2:07:53

here We've also included links to all the relevant resources And let me show you exactly how this works and how to

2:07:58

set it up step by step So essentially what's happening here is we're running

2:08:03

request and then we've plugged this into something called ampify Now ampify directly inside the appy store here they

2:08:11

have something called actors Now actors are like basically pre-built agents for

2:08:16

web scraping and AI automation projects right So you can get an API from any of these different models and then you can

2:08:22

plug that into NA10 and use this to build stuff out So as an example of that

2:08:28

I actually took the Google map scraper and then plugged that into NA10 to

2:08:34

create this automation Now you may say okay is this free or not So we actually get free usage and I rinsed it this

2:08:40

morning and it's only cost me 41 and you get $5 of free usage that resets every

2:08:46

month right So you can do this for free It is a scraper You can get the data and then you can plug that into a Google

2:08:52

sheet automatically You don't even have to map out the fields It's incredibly easy So you can see here I mapped it automatically to a Google sheet And it's

2:08:59

absolutely insane that you can do this Right So if you want to see exactly how to set this up let me show you So I'm

2:09:04

just going to zoom out here and I'll set it up from scratch as an example So let's say we

2:09:10

want to set up the scraper So we're going to click on HTTP request over here Then from here we're going to select

2:09:18

post And what we need to do is select whatever we want to scrape from these

2:09:25

actors inside the appy store Now if you're wondering okay which one do you want to use It depends on your use case

2:09:32

right So for example if you wanted to just get some details of local leads then Google Maps would be great If you

2:09:37

wanted to for example scrape Instagram and get like the latest viral post you could use the Instagram scraper There's

2:09:43

so many different apps inside here It's absolutely wild Facebook comment scraper even like LinkedIn profile scrapers

2:09:50

really powerful for lead generation but also just for scraping data and building stuff from the web right Even like for

2:09:55

example getting ideas for viral content from Tik Tok and places like that So for example if we go over to Google Maps and

2:10:02

then what we're going to do from here is we're going to type in whatever the search terms are that we want on Google

2:10:08

Maps right So let's say for example we wanted to search locally inside the US

2:10:14

We could select our city and location over here in the location section Then inside the

2:10:21

search terms we can select whatever we want So for example we could select restaurant And then here you get to

2:10:27

choose how many places you want to extract from the data right So for example do you want to extract 50

2:10:35

different responses or 30 or etc Right Obviously the more responses you use the more API credits you're going to use in

2:10:41

your free usage section here You can also for example choose whether you want to use like Google Maps listings and all that sort of thing But the point here is

2:10:48

that you can scrape almost anything you want using these free agents And the

2:10:54

cool thing as well about NA10 particularly is that with NA10 you can self-host this and then

2:11:01

it's free as well So then at that point you're not paying for NA10 you're not paying for a yeah all of this is pretty

2:11:08

free So it's really simple and easy So for example let's say we want to search restaurants in New York I don't know

2:11:14

something like Chinese restaurants right Let's say you're a lead gen agency targeting Chinese restaurants We can

2:11:21

take the information and then from here we're going to go to the API section So let's go to the API API endpoints And

2:11:27

then from here we're going to click get the run actor section So let's copy that

2:11:33

As you can see we're going to go back into the HTTP request We are going to also make sure

2:11:40

we select post instructions inside AI success lab if you want to get free access to this stuff So put the URL

2:11:46

method equals post Got the information right here And then we just need to make sure that we got the details plugged in

2:11:53

And also just make sure here that you've selected send body and then using from

2:11:58

here go back to ampify XF app and then go to the JSON section and inside the

2:12:04

JSON section you can just copy this code over here and you see here how it's selecting Chinese restaurants and it's

2:12:10

scraping 50 places inside the US Right now by doing

2:12:18

that you can see all the different search filters you've got inside here It's just like a Google search or like

2:12:24

using any sort of filter But the difference here is like you're scraping data and you're scraping live data like

2:12:29

you can see So then you're going to take that copy that plug it in here select JSON using JSON send body post and the

2:12:37

URL We'll test that step And you can see that has worked

2:12:42

perfectly All right So once you've set that up then what you can do is add

2:12:48

another HTTP request And inside this section you're going to keep it as get

2:12:54

So make sure that you select get here And then for the API you're going to go

2:12:59

to API endpoints And then from here you are going to select get last data set

2:13:06

items So if you go to get last data set items we'll copy that We'll go back to the web scraper Plug this in as URL Hit

2:13:14

test step and one thing we just need to do here quickly is just check on the runs

2:13:21

which we've done and then you can see an example right here So we just execute that workflow as an example This is for

2:13:28

the dentist workflow but you can see an example of how it works step by step here So let me

2:13:35

show you from scratch right here So we've got get then we'll get the endpoints Scroll down Get last run of

2:13:43

data set items Plug that in over here Hit test step Boom There we go If you want to

2:13:51

change the endpoints you want to change the filters etc Let's go back to Appify Google Map Scraper go back to manual then change

2:13:58

the search So let's say for example SEO agencies We want to scrape something like that We'll plug this in We'll

2:14:04

search in New York 50 places to extract Grab the endpoint

2:14:12

Get the run actor one Copy that Go back to NA10 Insert that into the first HTTP

2:14:19

request Post URL send JSON using JSON And then obviously if you change any of

2:14:25

the filters then the JSON changes as well So just copy that like you can see

2:14:30

Go back delete that plug that in Hit test step Make sure it works Boom

2:14:36

Shakalaka That's working nicely And then you can see all your previous runs over here You see what we're doing how we've

2:14:43

worked how much it cost right And you can see this is finishing scraping right

2:14:49

So what I would typically do if you wanted to run this from scratch you can add a new section here wait 22 seconds

2:14:58

before you go ahead and then that'll just allow the website scraper to scrape and complete

2:15:04

scraping before you move on to the next step which is this one And again we'll just test that

2:15:11

step And boom Look at that We've got all the internet marketing services and SEO agencies in the local area of New York

2:15:18

using that process Right Really simple and easy Now if you want to clean this up keep it all neat and tidy you can

2:15:25

click this button for tidying up in the bottom left And then if you want to add a new module let's say you want to send

2:15:30

this to Google Sheets or whatever we can add Google Sheets section here Append to

2:15:36

row So we'll click on append row in sheet and then inside this section we

2:15:41

can search dentists just for my random template

2:15:46

Then inside here we'll update that sheet And you get an option here which is map each column manually or map

2:15:53

automatically So I'm going to map automatically just save a bit of time And basically we've got all the headings

2:15:59

inside the spreadsheet mapped to the Google map scraping search Right So what

2:16:04

you can do here is if we click on test step now that's going to send all this information inside the Google sheet you

2:16:11

can see it's all been appended to the spreadsheet so we've got for example all these SEO agencies inside New York from

2:16:18

Google Maps listings and we're living the dreams my friend right now let's say

2:16:23

for example you wanted to take this information and then for example do some outreach there's a couple of ways you

2:16:29

could do that right you could take the information from the spreadsheet you could go up to chat GPT You could say something like "Okay

2:16:36

create a short funny personalized email to this person

2:16:43

from my SEO agency to sell white label

2:16:49

building to them right Something like that I'm going to use GPT4.1 because that's what I tend to like the most."

2:16:56

And now you can see he's created a interesting outreach email template based on the personalized

2:17:04

details of that lead Right So for example here it said let's millionify

2:17:10

right and millionify is the name of the agency even more millionify with easy link building something like that Right

2:17:16

So I hope business building I'm Julian Goldie found your agency How many tabs do you have open right now If the answer

2:17:21

is too many you don't need nothing on a plate Here's how we can help you Millionify plus our links equals your

2:17:27

client's ranking Your margin is laughing and you're finally having time for lunch blah blah blah So if you want this here you go We can insert our calendar link

2:17:34

Boom So that's one way to do it The other way you can do it is like for example you could go

2:17:41

inside This is super interesting You could take the information like

2:17:47

so get an AI agent right

2:17:54

Then we can define this information below We can take all the information from the Google sheet All right So for

2:18:00

example the title the address etc the

2:18:05

website like and then we can add a chat GPT agent So open AI chat model We'll

2:18:12

select GPT just for now And we can take the information from Google Sheets and

2:18:17

send that to the AI agent Right Now if we stop that workflow we can now tell the AI agent

2:18:23

with a system message you are an outreach

2:18:28

assistant helping me write emails for my

2:18:34

leads based on the information in the prompt Right And we've put in the

2:18:41

address the website the title We could put the neighborhood as well What else could we put I think that would be it to

2:18:48

be fair Category name maybe as well you want to include in there right And then you just label this

2:18:54

You put like title for example here And this is basically taking the information from the Google

2:18:59

sheet about the lead and then using that to just automate the outreach Right So

2:19:05

for example if we say okay lead details here based on the information in the

2:19:10

prompt write a nice personalized email right Something like that Then we can go

2:19:17

inside chat We just need to make sure that's working I think it's going to be okay So let's just test our workflow And

2:19:24

then you could chat with the AI agent and just use that to get responses So if we delete that

2:19:32

and then we add a new node here and we'll put chat trigger And then you can see it's taking the information from the

2:19:39

Google sheet right in the email based on this right Pretty simple and easy Boom

2:19:45

Now if you want to get access to all the templates etc Just go to the AI success

2:19:51

lab It is free Link in the comments in description You can get free access to this Go to the classroom go to the AI

2:19:57

course and then you'll see the latest module right here with the NA10 scraper agent details and you can just download

2:20:04

this JSON file like you can see So we can click that download it Then we can go back over to NA10 Just going to hit

2:20:11

save We'll exit that Open up a new workflow and we shall import the template that

2:20:17

I've given you for free So let's import that from file Open up the web

2:20:23

scraper And there you go You got the web scraper ready to go Obviously you need to plug in your own details inside this

2:20:30

but it's quite easy to set up Super simple Doesn't take much time at all All

2:20:35

right But basically it's one of the most powerful ways to do lead generation and automate it with AI right Because if you

2:20:41

combine the AI agent that we've built with the web scraper you can

2:20:47

create personalized emails It's really simple Doesn't take long at all And you can do it inside the chat nodes like so

2:20:53

Right now if you want like personalized coaching on this sort of stuff if you're struggling to implement it or you're struggling to actually get it loaded

2:21:00

into NAN etc then you can actually go to the AI profit boardroom which is

2:21:06

basically like an upgrade from the AI success lab right So come to all my best automations workflows templates AI

2:21:11

agents But the most important thing here is you get support right And I would say that's the biggest thing is like you

2:21:18

want to be in a group of people that are learning AI learning with you growing with you You can jump on weekly Q&A

2:21:23

calls We're actually increasing this to three calls per week which is going to be super

2:21:29

interesting So we're actually going to be launching coaching calls three times

2:21:34

per week inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description and you can get all the support you need from

2:21:40

the DMs from the community from the weekly coaching calls and the classroom modules inside here So if you really

2:21:45

want to learn and implement this stuff I would recommend the AR profit boardroom But if you want to get it for free you can get it inside here Feel free to get

2:21:51

it Let's try another one now So we're going to try and build something with for example Tik Tok So let's put in

2:21:58

a HTTP request here We can do that

2:22:04

In fact let's try Twitter just to mix it up So let's say we're targeting like

2:22:10

content around AI agents We want the latest content maybe like the top 10

2:22:17

tweets then we can do that So we'll grab the API key So grab the endpoint over

2:22:23

here We'll copy that Go back in here Post URL here Then inside the send

2:22:32

body we'll select using JSON Then we'll grab the JSON over here

2:22:39

I'm flying through it now because I've already shown you how to do this stuff We'll copy this Go back in

2:22:44

here Plug this in Hit test step That's running now And then for

2:22:52

example what we can do here is we can add a new HTTP request We're going to link that in

2:22:59

We'll just select it on get Then we're going to take the URL from the API So let's grab that We'll get the endpoint

2:23:05

as you can see We'll scroll down We'll get the last run data set items Copy that Then we're going to go back to NAN

2:23:12

Paste in the URL over here You don't need to do anything else And you can see the node is executed perfectly and we're

2:23:18

good to go on that Happy days All right So it's really easy to set this up Once you get the hang of it once you get your

2:23:24

head around it it's super simple stuff And as promised inside the AI success lab link in the comments description if

2:23:31

you go down to the NA10 scraper agent like you can see you can download the template in the

2:23:37

resources section You got all the links over here You've even got the template for the spreadsheet that I used as you can see And this is completely free

2:24:16

serious entrepreneurs who are serious about scaling and learning how to use AI automation to make more money and save

2:24:21

time Feel free to get that link in the comments description Today I'm going to show you how to automate posting reels

## Automating Social Media Posts with NA 10

2:24:28

to social media automatically And this works with Tik Tok Instagram Twitter basically any platform you can post to

2:24:34

You can automate the posting of social media content easily to any platform right Using this NA10 workflow And you

2:24:42

can see an example over here So here's an example This is an

2:24:48

automated post to social media with AI The whole video was actually generated with AI and it's very easy to actually

2:24:54

post that directly to social media as well Right So for example this was actually posted through this NA10

2:25:01

workflow and you can see an example So we actually took the video from platform called blow sent it over and then posted

2:25:09

it directly to Tik Tok on autopilot along with the captions and everything else Again you can set this up for

2:25:15

Instagram or any other platform and it's very easy to do with this AI agent So if you want to do this super simple

2:25:21

workflow and you can automate this so you can generate videos say every hour and then post those automatically every

2:25:27

hour to social media like you can see in this example So what we're doing here for example is we're scheduling the

2:25:34

trigger which is going to be every hour So if you want to set this up let me show you exactly how it works I'll start

2:25:40

up a new workflow inside N10 for you just to build it from

2:25:46

scratch All right So you're going to click on create a new workflow in the top Then from here we can just add a new

2:25:51

step and we'll call this schedule trigger like you can see Now you can

2:25:57

schedule this hourly or every 20 minutes however often you create content But essentially what we're doing here is

2:26:03

we're going to schedule this to run on autopilot so that we don't need to post ourselves And this is going to take URLs

2:26:08

from a spreadsheet read them and then post them directly to social media So let me add

2:26:13

another module like you can see right here And basically what this is doing is reading our spreadsheet and then put in

2:26:20

the outputs over here So if you want to set this up you would just click on the plus sign type in Google

2:26:26

Sheets as a module and then from here you're going to select get rows So if we

2:26:32

type in get rows in a sheet this will take the data from our pre-formatted sheet Now if you need a template for the

2:26:40

sheet let me give you an example So you can see an example right here And if you

2:26:46

need to steal that sheet from me link in the comments in description to the free community where you can get all of these

2:26:51

templates for free All right you can see what it's basically doing is taking the idea the caption the production the

2:26:57

environment and then plugging that into our sheet So if we want to take that

2:27:02

we're going to take the spreadsheet from Google Docs We'll take the spreadsheet

2:27:07

named NA10 from my Google Drive And then we're just going to select the sheet which is this one

2:27:14

And you can actually filter this by production So if you had like options for like pre-production not ready for

2:27:19

production etc then you can select that inside column D So for example here we

2:27:27

can select all the inputs and we'll just click on test step and you can see now

2:27:32

it's taken all the information from our spreadsheet So we got the row ID caption etc Okay Now from here what we can

2:27:41

do is we can use a JSON input to create the next step So

2:27:50

you can see here we've got this new setup and basically what we're doing here is we're taking the information

2:27:55

from Google Sheets and then plugging that into JSON format All right So we got mode equals then and what this is

2:28:02

doing is it's actually taking a platform called blot which is an amazing name by the way

2:28:08

and then it makes it really easy to post to different social medias Now there's many platforms where you can do this but

2:28:13

honestly if you want to automate it I think potato number one has the most amount of platforms and number two it

2:28:20

makes it very easy to set up So let me show you what I mean You can actually get a free trial and you can try it for

2:28:27

free But basically this allows you to grab an ID So if we go and log in here

## Setting Up Your Free Account and Logging In

2:28:33

you sign up for a free account you can get a free trial And then inside your

2:28:39

settings you can grab an ID right So you can see here for example we've got account IDs for my Tik

2:28:47

Tok for Twitter etc right And so what we're doing here is we can log in with

## Connecting Your Social Media Platforms

2:28:53

any of these platforms You just click login Really easy and simple Then you can connect your platforms like you can

2:28:59

see And then you can grab the account ID and plug that into JSON format inside

2:29:05

N10 So you can see here for example squiggly bracket quote marks Tik Tok

2:29:11

colon then the ID from my platform and then the key over here All right So

2:29:16

that's basically it That's going to send it over to blot and we'll just test that out There

2:29:22

we go And basically what this is doing is grabbing the ID So it's taking the

2:29:28

information from the JSON format here pulling that into the output And then the final bit is the post section here

## Configuring API Keys and HTTP Requests

2:29:36

So what you can do is you set up a new HTTPS request Then you're going to select post

2:29:42

as a method use this URL for the back end So post

2:29:47

into blow potato and then inside the send header section here you're going to plug in your API

2:29:54

key Right now I'm going to delete my API key after this video you never want to be showing your

2:30:01

API keys online because obviously it's like a password that you're sharing with everyone But essentially if you want to post to social media automatically then

2:30:08

you would get your API key Now if you're wondering how to get an API key you would just go inside your settings So

2:30:17

my.bloat.com/s settings and then scroll down here and you can get API access Right now if you copy that API key you

2:30:24

can plug it into your NA10 workflow like you can see And then the format for setting this up is blow hyphen API key

2:30:32

all lowerase That's how it's set up And then underneath you're going to select

2:30:37

send body And inside the send body section here using the fields below you're going

2:30:43

to put the name and the value So inside the name section we just put URL and

2:30:50

then inside the value section we take the URL from cl like you can see right

2:30:56

So I've got this sort on clean You you can get it wherever you want If you look at my previous video and the previous

2:31:02

section you'll see that I've got a full automation on this If you want an automation to create reels like you can

2:31:08

see in this video then you can get that inside the AICO success lab like you can see All right pretty simple and easy So

2:31:17

now you set that up Really isn't simple We're just going to test it out Make sure it works There we go So you've got

2:31:24

that ready to go That's been sent over to Blow And then this is the easy bit You're just going to connect it to

## Automating Social Media Posts

2:31:29

whatever social media platform you want right So for example if you just want to do Tik Tok like I did and again you can

2:31:35

do this to all platforms Like it doesn't have to be limited to Tik Tok Could be Instagram Threads Pinterest Blue Sky

2:31:42

YouTube Twitter etc Whichever platforms allow you to post videos right If you can't post videos to Pinterest then you

2:31:49

wouldn't use this automation unless you're posting images But essentially that's how it works Okay So inside here

2:31:55

we are going to set up the HTTP request So it's going to be post Let's select post over here Then inside the URL we're

2:32:04

going to use the back end for blot potato like you can see And again if you want to get like any of the URLs you can

2:32:09

actually get the automation from me inside the AS6 success lab like you can see inside the resources section and

2:32:15

you'll see screenshots step by step where you can actually view all the settings for each module Right So if you want to steal this stuff from me you can

2:32:21

just grab it right there inside here Right I also add it to the AR profit boardroom which comes with like weekly

2:32:27

coaching and all sorts of upgrades on that So now we're going to click send

2:32:32

headers We're going to send the bloat potato API key which is the same as

2:32:39

before And then we just have to send the body which is a JSON So if we send body use JSON Take this in Plug it in

2:32:49

over here Hit test step Make sure that works Post submitted

2:32:56

Boom We should be good to go on that All right So if we go over to my profile on Tik

2:33:04

Tok here we go That was a video I literally just posted Pretty awesome And

2:33:10

it was easy to automate with AI We create the whole video with AI and it's posted social media with AI Unbelievable

2:33:19

So that's basically how it works So if we go back to automation now the only thing that I would do here is just make

## Renaming Workflow Steps for Clarity

2:33:25

sure you do actually rename all the steps right Keep it neat and tidy So for example in the Google Sheets section I'm

2:33:30

just going to call that get URLs from Google Sheets And then inside the HTTP

2:33:35

request I'm going to rename that and say post send video And then for each social

2:33:43

media platform that you add so for example Tik Tok then you just rename this as well So if we click on rename

2:33:50

we'll type in Tik Tok here Hit rename hit save on that and then we're good to go on this All right You can also

2:33:57

activate this So you can activate the workflow and then it will run on autopilot every hour based on your

2:34:03

scheduled trigger If you want to test the workflow you can see we can test that like so that's firing over and

2:34:08

we'll probably post it to for the bird time to social media like you can see All right so that's works perfectly

2:34:14

Let's go back to Tik Tok now Go on the profile and you're good to

2:34:21

go on that All right there's a video ready to go Simple and easy So if you

2:34:26

want to automate shorts like you can see this is exactly how to do it You can post to any

2:34:33

platform I've shown you how to do it for Instagram and everywhere else and it is pretty awesome Now again if you don't

## Importing and Using JSON Templates

2:34:40

want to set all this stuff up yourself then you can download the JSON file So you can download that and then

2:34:48

if you go to NA10 click on import Just going to save on that before

2:34:54

I overwrite it import from file Here we

2:35:01

go Insert the JSON We've just literally just popped in

2:35:07

that JSON file right there Right So if you just want the template to easily import you can do it like so No problem

2:35:12

at all And that's probably the easiest and fastest way to do it to be fair So

2:35:18

it's absolutely amazing what you can do Again if you haven't seen it already let's go back to the ARC success lab So

2:35:24

inside here as well you've got the NA10 shorts automation right and you can get the JSON file to import here and

2:35:30

basically inside here as in you can actually automate the full video itself

## Generating and Organizing Video Ideas

2:35:36

and it was really easy to do with this NAN workflow right so if you want to learn how to actually automate the

2:35:42

workflow how to create videos etc you can see step by step this is exactly how

2:35:47

from stage one down to stage six we automated the images the video itself the audio for the image and even the

2:35:54

idea and the prompts for the video as well and then stitched it all together down here and then sent it over to

2:35:59

Google Sheets So it's a beautiful automation and if you combine the power

2:36:05

of posting social media automatically like you can see and you combine that with the power of automating shorts then

2:36:13

you've basically got something that can automate shorts post them 24/7 and it's incredibly easy to do Plus if you are

2:36:20

too lazy to set this up or you're like I just can't be bothered then you can grab the JSONs and import them directly

2:36:25

inside NATM Right So link in the comments description to this Just go to the classroom AI course and you can see

2:36:32

## Creating and Managing AI Workflows

2:37:33

Bye-bye Today I'm going to show you how to automate shorts like you can see right here So this is an example of a

2:37:40

short as you automated with NA10 And it's actually not that hard to automate this I'm going to give you the full free

2:37:46

template today as well as I'll show you how to post plus create the video And you don't even need to come up with the

2:37:51

idea itself Now it's pretty simple So here is the full automation that I used to create it So you can see an example

2:37:57

right here This is the example of the short that was created and then the final output And then additionally these

2:38:05

are the accounts that can go viral You can see a bunch of AI automated animal related videos absolutely popping up on

2:38:12

Tik Tok and you can now easily automate them using the process I'm about to show you So let's get straight into it and

2:38:19

I'll show you exactly how this works So essentially what we've got here is stage one stage two stage three stage four

2:38:25

stage five and stage six of the process This is actually an automation I learned

2:38:31

from Robotnuggets on YouTube You can see his original video right here Would

2:38:37

definitely recommend checking out But essentially this is how you can build the full automation And if you want to

2:38:42

get the full template from me you can get it for free inside the AI success lab Just click the link in the

2:38:48

description to get access to that You can download the JSON then import it directly into NA10 as a free template So

2:38:55

if we have a look at this automation basically what we're doing step by step is first of all we are generating the

2:39:00

idea So you can see here we've generated the idea and this is the idea generator

2:39:06

We're using chat GBT basically to just come up with related and relevant video ideas that we can create and automate a

2:39:13

short about Right So you don't even need to come up with your own ideas If you do have something in mind then you can easily put that into the prompt and let

2:39:19

me show you exactly how this looks step by step If you want to build it yourself so we're going to open up a new tab

2:39:25

inside NA10 if you want to have a look at this I've actually got a freehour course on NASA on YouTube if you need to

2:39:30

check out anything more on this And essentially if you go over here open up the

2:39:35

workspace you can start creating your own workflow just like this If we go to

2:39:41

create workflow in the top right and then from here we're going to start building stuff out Now the cool thing about this is it's automated So it's

2:39:48

scheduled to trigger every hour if we want to or we can trigger midnight or whatever we want right So we can have

2:39:54

days between triggers We could set this up to trigger every hour So we could say every 60 minutes generate a new short

2:40:01

And it's incredibly easy to do So first thing you do is just set up a trigger So

2:40:06

let's say for example schedule trigger And if we switch this now to hours and

2:40:11

let's say you want a short to come out every 60 minutes You can set up hours then 1 hour and then you're good to go

2:40:17

on that Right from here and this is stage one of the process we're then going to come up with the idea generator

2:40:24

like you can see So the way that we're going to do this is click on the plus sign and then from here we shall click on chat and open AAI and then the method

2:40:33

for doing this is message model resource equals text operation

2:40:40

equals message model and model is I honestly for speed I would recommend

2:40:45

using chat GBT40 but if you want like the best quality prompts then I would recommend using GPT 4.1 So that's up to

2:40:54

you how you want to set this up But if you want to get similar outputs to what I created then you can easily use chat

2:41:00

GBT40 And obviously that's going to be a lot cheaper for you as well Right inside here we can simplify the output And then

2:41:06

we're going to put the output content It's JSON And then inside this

2:41:11

section we're good to go All right Now we just need to select this prompt If

2:41:16

you want the full prompt or if you just want to steal this stuff from me then just get it inside the AI success lab

2:41:23

You can grab the blueprint down here and you can see all the resource links like but essentially if we paste that prompt in directly here this is going to come

2:41:30

up with the ideas for our prompt for our videos So you see here it says you're an AI designed to generate compelling viral

2:41:39

video short ideas for social media And I've put just for for fun I've put make it jungle themed about animals in the

2:41:45

jungle You could easily change this and say okay make it SEO themed for example whatever your niche is whatever you want

2:41:50

to post about it doesn't have to be about anything in particular right so whether you want it to come up with ideas for you whether you want the ideas

2:41:58

to be generated automatically you can do it directly inside this prompt here and if you look at the outputs like it's

2:42:04

pretty amazing what it came up with so for this example it came up with the caption so it's like monkey steals

2:42:11

tourist GoPro and films jungle life it came up with the hashtag tags posted it

2:42:17

automatically to social media and then you can see this is 1 minute long this short which is pretty cool as well You could also monetize the account and the

2:42:24

images are super nice In fact these are not images but you see the point and

2:42:29

essentially then the monkey just goes off and films the jungle and that sort of thing right Films always chunky mate

2:42:35

jungle maze And so this is basically how it goes step by step And then from here

2:42:40

what you're going to do is you're just going to change this So let's say for example we're going to say

2:42:45

make it SEO themed and educational right Then we're just going to test this step

2:42:50

At each stage you want to test the step make sure it actually works because if you don't test the

2:42:55

steps then you don't know if it's going to work or not right So for example here for our business related content it said

2:43:01

the day Google got a cold comes up with the ideas and then it's like a quirky animated story follows Google the Google

2:43:08

robot who catches a cold and accidentally buries a small business site until an SEO detective metamax

2:43:13

saves the date with metadata and backlinks Right So it's very creative in the way that it comes up with ideas and

2:43:18

it's all automated using NAN So once you've set this up you've now

2:43:23

got the idea generator right And that is stage one Stage one is complete my friends And

2:43:29

that was really easy right Now stage two is actually taking the video prompts So

2:43:35

taking the ideas and then generating video prompts Now if you want an example of this and you want to know how to set

2:43:42

it up and just set up nice and clean like you can see see you got stage one stage two etc Then that's pretty simple

2:43:47

as well And so all you do is you can press shift and S and that will generate

2:43:54

a sticky note for you and then you can annotate that All right So for example here we'll put stage

2:43:59

one idea generation We're good to go All right So

2:44:05

stage one idea generating Here's a schedule trigger Here it is step by step Boom Now we're going to do stage two And

2:44:13

I'm just going to resize that so it looks nice and neat And here we're going to duplicate and take this down And this

2:44:20

will be stage two We shall call this idea to

2:44:26

prompts So now if you want to change the color of the sticky note just keep it nice and organized You can do it like so

2:44:31

So you can select different colors right here And then we can keep going along So the next stage is to take the idea and

2:44:38

plug it into a Google sheet And this just keeps everything organized Plus you can see what's ready for production etc

2:44:44

So if we type in Google Sheets over here then from this section we

2:44:50

shall select if we click on this just double check sheet within document All

2:44:55

right so the operation is going to be append row We're going to select append row and then I'm just going to choose a

2:45:02

spreadsheet from my Google drive Let's take that one Then we're going to

2:45:07

take the sheet here second Here we go and we'll take the

2:45:13

sheet and then we're going to map each column manually inside the spreadsheet and essentially just so you understand

2:45:19

what's going on here So at this point we are creating a nice Google sheet template like you can see we've got the

2:45:25

idea the caption the production environment and the final output which is actually the video file right so if we click on that actually take us to the

2:45:32

video file to download we've got the video file downloaded and ready to post to social media and you can actually

2:45:38

automate the posting of social media as well which I'll come on to so you can

2:45:43

see the ID the caption production environment final output and the ID as well what you would do is you just map

2:45:50

out the document By the way this is inside the school group You can just grab the NAM workflow and then make a

2:45:56

copy of it So you just go to file make copy of the spreadsheet And from here the ID we're going to put

2:46:06

row minus one All right that's basically going to label the ID So video one video two etc

2:46:12

Minus one because obviously we're not starting from row one We're starting from row two Row one has the headers

2:46:18

inside it Then from here we're going to take the idea which is generated by Chad GPT We then have the title the

2:46:26

environment etc All right So the caption we can take as the title The production we can just type in

2:46:33

like for production for example Environment we can just drag and drop that And that's going to be dynamic

2:46:40

each time this workflow generates And then final output we keep blank cuz we're going to generate that later with

2:46:45

VRL which I'll come on to in a minute All right So this is basically how you can map out the content of your videos

2:46:53

into an NA10 workflow Pretty simple and easy So we got stage one idea generation Stage two idea at the prompts And then

2:47:00

what we're going to do from here is we're going to set up the prompt generator All right So this is a message

2:47:06

model We'll click on plus We'll type in message Type in chat

2:47:12

GPT Then message model And if you want to save time here

2:47:18

you can just duplicate this right So we can right click this click on duplicate and then from here we've got

2:47:26

the AI model duplicated right Just saves you time when you're setting this up Now

2:47:31

you can also rename each module just to keep it clean and organized So for example here we can put video idea

2:47:40

generator And then inside this section we'll call that prompt generator And if

2:47:45

you have any questions as we go along feel free to comment Happy to help or post inside the AI community link in the

2:47:51

comments and we can help you out All right so with the idea generator then we're going to do the prompt generator

2:47:57

which we got here and we're going to start setting this up Now the way that we're going to

2:48:03

set this up is we're going to just copy the original prompt So we're going to

2:48:09

open this up and take that and plug this in Right So basically what we're doing here is we're saying you're a hyper

2:48:16

realistic prompt engine built for generating ultra specific documentary style image prompts Make the prompt

2:48:22

simple and easy Okay And then your objective is to create a 13 scene static

2:48:28

photo sequence Here's what to do Here's how to do it etc And the first thing we

2:48:33

need to do just before we do that is just test each step So we're taking the data from the previous module plugging

2:48:39

it into the next one And also if you want to save the outputs So let's say for example you don't want to generate

2:48:45

this every single time You want to pick up where you left off You don't want to have to test each part of the workflow each time Then what you can do

2:48:52

here is you can actually pin these Right So if you right

2:48:57

click the module click pin this will save the output So you don't need to test the workflow every single time

2:49:02

you're setting this up All right And then you can also save here as well So inside the prompt generator we're

2:49:09

just going to take this information plug it in here then we'll click test And

2:49:16

there we go So you got examples here of what we're doing step by step Now we're

2:49:22

just going to flick to expression like you can see And inside expression basically this allows dynamic

2:49:29

fields So it takes the inputs and the ideas and the environment and everything else and plugs it over here

2:49:35

So you always want to be testing each step just making sure that the outputs are what you expect because if you don't get the right outputs from the previous

2:49:42

module the next module is not going to work very well So you can see here now it's come back with the ideas the

2:49:47

stepby-step scenes etc So Google Chrome Roma blah blah blah here's what it's

2:49:52

doing step by step and there we go And by the way if you just want to copy and paste all the

2:49:58

prompts for me get it inside the AIC success lab you can just steal the JSON

2:50:04

right there Right And then from there you would just go to import from URL or

2:50:10

import from file and upload the JSON file So you can see here we've got some formatting Now this just makes the code

2:50:16

more accessible for the next steps in the process So we're going to click on add module click code and then we're

2:50:22

going to take the code from here plug it in test out a step And now you see how

2:50:30

this has turned all the stepby-step scenes from here So we've got scene one scene two scene three etc It's plugged

2:50:37

it into a full description here which is going to make it better and easier for the next stage in the process Right So

2:50:42

when we're asking the AI to generate the outputs this is going to be much easier digest for the AI And that is stage two

2:50:50

completed All right So stage one idea generation Stage two video prompts And

2:50:55

then we're going to move on to stage three which is generating the images So I'm just going to duplicate this sticky

2:51:01

note again We'll plug that down here We'll rename this So this is where it

2:51:06

starts getting interesting because now we're going to generate the images right So even if you didn't want to make videos you can now generate images on

2:51:13

autopilot too Like you can see So inside the generate images section what we're

## Generating Images and Videos with AI

2:51:20

going to do now is we're going to do a HTTP request right And the model that

2:51:26

we're going to be using for this is Flux Now Flux is pretty good for generating

2:51:32

images in a cost effective way And the way that you're going to do this is click the plus sign down here and then

2:51:38

you're going to type in HTTP quest Then you're going to switch this over to

2:51:45

post So we'll take this and then the other thing that we need to do here is select send

2:51:51

headers So if we select send headers then we're going to take authorization

2:51:56

and we're going to get an API key which I'll show you how to do in a second All right So if you want to get an API key

2:52:02

you're going to go to foul AI Now F AI is really good for

2:52:08

generating videos sound images etc And it's all inside one single platform

2:52:15

which makes it much easier It's kind of like open router but for multimedia not just for generating text So with foul

2:52:22

you can grab an API key You can see I've got my API key plugged in which I'll delete after the video And the way that

2:52:28

you can get an API key here is if you go to API keys at the top then you're going to click add key

2:52:35

And then you're going to copy the API key that you get back like you can see Make sure you do copy it because the

2:52:41

problem is once you've set this up you can't go back and view the key right So

2:52:46

if I click on that I can't view it I can only delete it So just something to bear in mind

2:52:52

there But once you've set that up we can then start using Flux to generate the images So you can see here we're using

2:53:00

Q.fall.run and then the URL basically for creating images with Flux on

2:53:06

autopilot So we've got the URL for Flux We've added the

2:53:11

headers authorization Plugged in the key there And then for this next session

2:53:17

we're just going to click on send body We're going to select the type as raw

2:53:23

application/json is the content type So you select JSON there All right So raw

2:53:29

and then application/json And then inside the body here you're going to take this

2:53:34

section here plug it in Boom Ready to go So we're just going to test that step

2:53:39

now And as you can see that's basically sent a bunch of requests over to Flux

2:53:45

for each scene inside the prompts Right So let me talk you through what we're doing here to generate this cheeky

2:53:53

little video right here We had to come up with the idea The way that we did that was we selected this stage idea

2:54:02

like let me show you what I mean Uh so we had to generate the idea which we did over here that's sent over to Google

2:54:08

Sheets Google Sheets created the prompts for the images and then you can see here

2:54:14

we're generating the images in this section using a HTTP request and the models that we're using here are chat

2:54:20

GPT and also flux for now but we'll come on to more in a second So you can see here we've selected the body We're

2:54:27

creating the images like so We've plugged that information into our workflow and that's

2:54:34

generated all these images Now if you want to see what has been created so

2:54:40

far let me show you how So if we go back to the AICS success lab and then you're

2:54:45

going to click on blocks So this link right here Then

2:54:51

you're going to click on requests And inside requests you can see all these requests we've created for the Google

2:54:57

bot So these are basically like the images we're generating to start creating our short video our faceless

2:55:04

video So if we go back inside here we've sent the request over to Flux to

2:55:11

generate the images And now what we're going to do is we are going

2:55:17

to add a new section which is just wait right So it takes a minute or so like

2:55:22

you can see for the images to generate So we're going to add a new module called wait Just add a second there

2:55:29

Click test step Make sure that works You can see that's waited So we've got everything inside the queue And then from here

2:55:36

we're going to click on get images So if we click on get images which is another

2:55:43

request type that in And then from here we're going to copy the URL plug that in All right So

2:55:51

this is the request for taking the images from Flux

2:55:56

So what you can see here is we're doing the request We're choosing the method as

2:56:01

get take the from Flux add in the JSON format after that and then we need to

2:56:07

click on send headers Inside the send headers section here we've got authorization and we're

2:56:13

just going to plug in our API key again Okay And then we also need to send body type

2:56:20

So let's click on that And then from here we'll type in

2:56:25

this into body section and just double check that All right So we've got the

2:56:31

files ready to go So what you can see here is these are the actual files generated by Flux that we've

2:56:37

literally just generated a second ago which is pretty cool And so we can not

2:56:42

just generate the images with a HTTP request but we can also get those images directly from Flux And now we're

2:56:49

automating and we're getting pretty close to towards generating the videos and that sort of thing Now another thing

2:56:56

you can do here at the bottom is you can select options and then batching And

2:57:02

this will just help you avoid some errors So if you select options here and then from this section you can just

2:57:08

select 2,00 milliseconds click test step and that

2:57:14

will just stop it from having any errors Right So if there's any errors or if you overload

2:57:20

the server etc then you can bash URLs and it will just help you avoid any errors along the way So there we go

2:57:27

We've got the files back now Boom And you can see there's multiple pages here at the bottom and we've completed stage

2:57:34

three So just to recap here we've created the idea we've generated the

## Stitching and Finalizing Your Video

2:57:39

video prompts we've generated the images and now it's time to start generating the videos So what we can do from this

2:57:46

section is if we click on create video

2:57:52

prompts let me show you how So we're going to duplicate this We'll call this Stage four is

2:58:00

create video prompts Now we're going to click the plus sign Just drag that down there Type in chat GBT Hit open AI And

2:58:08

then from this section what we can do is we can click on analyze image So what

2:58:15

this going to do it's going to analyze the images that we've generated just a second ago So you've got the images

2:58:21

generated from the URLs which you can see over here We're going to drag that over

2:58:27

So we'll drag that over to image URL section We're going to select the model as chat GBT4 latest There we go And then

2:58:37

what's in the image We're going to take that Right So this basically analyzes the images from our prompts and also the

2:58:45

image URLs which we've got down here So I'm just going to grab the prompt from

2:58:51

the previous part of the workflow and and we'll cut that and plug it

2:58:57

inside here There we go All right So again this is a dynamic JSON prompt

2:59:04

based on the prompts from before and the URLs from the images we generated We'll just test that And as an

2:59:12

example you can see for the GoPro monkey image that we generated the video it's broken it down step by step So it's like

2:59:18

a young monkey grips a black GoPro with both hands crouch low on a lichencoed

2:59:25

rock A soft sunlight brushes the tips of his orange foot Right So simple prompts

2:59:30

easy to generate and we're automating it with this process So if we go back to

2:59:35

the example prompt and we compare that versus the output So a young monkey you see it's quite a small monkey right

2:59:41

there grabs a black GoPro which we've got over here crouched on a

2:59:48

rock There's the rock and the sunlight is gracing fur which you've got over

2:59:54

here Right So it's basically mapping out exactly what we want inside the image Now it can take a while for that to

3:00:00

generate but you can see now we've got that generated The reason it takes a little bit longer than usual is because you're analyzing these images which does

3:00:07

take time So from here we've created the

3:00:13

video prompts and we're now going to do an HTTP request for video generation And

3:00:19

the model that we're going to use inside here is cling So if we click on HTTP request then we're going to select post

3:00:26

as the method like so Then we're going to use this URL as the URL for

3:00:33

generating the outputs By the way any part of this video if you need the prompts if you just want to steal them

3:00:39

from me I'm showing them on the screen You can pause the video take a screenshot and just ask chat GPT to type

3:00:44

them out if you need to right Or you can just download the template from school

3:00:50

and then plug that in And this school is free right So inside the authentication

3:00:56

section we're good to go And then inside the send header section here we are now

3:01:01

going to select authorization And again we'll take that value for the API key

3:01:08

Like you can see inside the send body section we're going to select

3:01:13

raw application JSON and then we'll copy the body like

3:01:20

so So if we test that step now and one thing you should do as you go along here is just make sure that you label

3:01:28

everything right So for example you see how we've got get images on stage three rows over here Just going to do that now

3:01:34

Change this to get images We'll hit rename like escape off

3:01:40

that And then if we go inside the get images section we're now going to plug in the prompt that we found before We'll

3:01:47

keep going through Xiao says hi Shout out to you And let's just wait for this to load

3:01:55

There we go All right then we're just going to test this again Just waiting

3:02:01

for this to load So bear with me There we go So now this should work

3:02:08

Let's just hit test step Make sure this works Okay Yeah there we go Good to go on that

3:02:14

And I'm just going to rename this video creator so I know exactly what it does

3:02:20

etc And then we're going to wait again So I'm just going to add a wait section here We'll wait a second But again if

3:02:27

you were like generating the outputs here it might take 4 minutes for Cling to actually come up with outputs So

3:02:33

that's what we're doing step by step And also in this section you can see we're using Cling Video right Cling video

3:02:40

That's what we're using Now I'm using the standard version You can use the pro version which is even better to be

3:02:45

honest So if you want like better quality images or something like that like this was just a test run The images

3:02:50

still look good to be fair the videos But if you want even better responses then you can switch your models right So

3:02:57

for example if we go inside the course again then we're going to go to requests Inside the request section

3:03:04

here you can see the inputs for the video and what we've created so far But

3:03:10

if we actually go back here we can switch on the drop down to pro right

3:03:16

Image to video pro And that will just make sure that the images you're using are even better quality So if you want

3:03:22

the creme de la creme but you're willing to pay more then you would use video pro If you want like the standard sort of

3:03:29

usage then you're going to switch to image to video From here we've done that We've worked our magic We're just going

3:03:34

to wait a second here Generate the outputs There we go We're good to go And

3:03:40

then what we're going to do is click on get video Right So we're going to add another HTTP

3:03:47

request Click get Type in the URL to get requests which you can see right here

3:03:53

Now important thing to note here is if you have a space after the request URL

3:03:58

it's not going to work All right So make sure that you use the exact same format that we've got right here And then we've

3:04:04

attached a dynamic JSON request from the previous responses which is going to get the cling video step by step Right

3:04:13

now just to recap here you've got get you've got URL inside the settings as well You would send

3:04:19

headers using fields below Then you can select the name and the value for your

3:04:24

API key Again you ever typing stuff like this especially if you're sending headers and stuff like that you've got

3:04:29

to get it precise If you add the wrong keys and stuff like that it's not going to work So for example with the API key

3:04:34

we put key space and then we have the rest of the field right here And then

3:04:40

for sending the body we'll select that You can just

3:04:45

duplicate it from the last one but I just want to make sure it's super clear what we're doing here and how we're doing it For sending the body we're

3:04:51

going to take the description from the prompt And then we're going to put the batch in

3:04:59

as one and 2,000 C interval time Just test how it works Some people are asking

3:05:06

like how do you get access to the templates etc So let me show you how

3:05:11

this works step by step So let's say you are watching the live stream You can

3:05:16

click on the video find the description down here Click on

3:05:22

that and then inside here go to classroom AI course and then you can find the

3:05:29

template and all the resources down here So go to classroom and then AI course

3:05:34

Hope that makes sense Just going to double check this make sure we've got it all right And

3:05:40

also it does take a while for the outputs to generate on cling right So if you want to see where you're up to in

3:05:46

terms of generating the outputs from Clling then we can go out to Clling over

3:05:51

here We're going to go into requests And you can see for example

3:05:58

the videos ready to go over here Pretty cool Charles says "Good to see your show

3:06:05

You seem to be doing good works." Thank you very much sir And then I'm just going to change this

3:06:11

as well to video And there we go Just one thing

3:06:17

to bear in mind here when you're doing this make sure you got everything set up

3:06:22

correctly Otherwise it can break It is temperamental So you want to make sure everything's matching nicely Now once

3:06:28

you've done that you'll see an example like this So you just test step at each stage Here's an example And then you're

3:06:35

going to move on to the next stage All right So we get the video like so Here's

3:06:42

an example You're good to go on that Then you got stage five So stage five is

3:06:48

where you start generating the sound Now I'm using GPT4.1 for this Again it is a

3:06:54

little bit slow So if you don't want to use it you can just test something else You can see an example of the output

3:07:00

right here And then this again is a chat GBT message model We've got the prompt

3:07:08

like basically it's just a prompt to generate the music So for example it looks at the image is a lively symphony of rainforest life unfills leaves

3:07:15

whisper overhead as a humid breeze stirs through the treetops Beautiful and

3:07:20

poetic And it's got descriptions for each scene Then from there it's going to start creating the sound Now this is

3:07:26

another HTTPS request post We're using audio for generating

3:07:33

this plug in your API key again and then send body select raw JSON and here's the

3:07:39

example of the prompt that we're using Then you're going to wait a second and then from there get the sounds So what

3:07:45

this does is it takes the audio from audio you send the headers you send the

3:07:52

body there's the descriptions etc and you're good to go on that And that leaves us with stage six Now stage six

3:08:00

you're basically stitching everything together You're taking all the code then putting it into a format it

3:08:07

can actually understand So it's taking all the URLs It's downloaded It can download the

3:08:15

video So this is like a 5-second clip It's taking all the 5 seconds that we've generated with cling and stitching them

3:08:22

together So you can see here what we've done We've said code list elements run

3:08:28

for all items language JavaScript and then here's the code to generate that that's going to stitch the video using

3:08:35

another HTTP request supposed here's what we do the headers and then raw

3:08:41

content type equals JSON again you're just going to take the URLs like so these are all the video URLs we're

3:08:47

plugging in so you can just drag those in then you're going to wait a second and this gets the final video so for

3:08:52

example if we take a look at this output and we open this up This is the final

3:08:58

output of the video we generated Like you can see downloads it automatically

3:09:04

And then the final thing that we want to do is just plug that into our Google sheet So here's an example of all the

3:09:10

settings we're using the idea etc Here's the code that we plugged in

3:09:16

And basically what that's going to do with the final output is it's going to match the column

3:09:23

based on the idea We're mapping it manually Then it's going to look up that

3:09:28

idea and plug it into our Google sheet So if we go back to the Google

3:09:33

sheet template which you've got free access to it will plug it directly into

3:09:39

the sheet as you can see right here So this will plug directly into the Google sheet

3:09:44

and have the URL So that's basically it for automating reels The next part that

## Automating Social Media Posting

3:09:50

I'll come on to later is how to actually automate the posting of all of this

3:09:57

directly to social media So just to recap here we've come up with the idea the video prompts generated the images

3:10:02

generated the videos created the sound stitched it all together then plug that URL into a Google sheet And with the

3:10:09

Google sheet we can actually take the outputs and then automate posting that directly to social media as well So

3:10:16

here's an example right So if we look at this one you can see that for the idea

3:10:21

of a monkey we've got the caption production the environment and then the

3:10:27

final output of the URL which takes us to this video that we've just downloaded

3:10:34

and you can automate posting that directly to social media like you can see which I'll come on to in the next

3:10:43

video So that's basically it That's how to automate and create reels with just one idea You don't even need to come up

3:10:49

with the idea yourself and it's super powerful using this whole spreadsheet So

3:10:55

SEO automations as well feel free to book in a free SEO strategy session link in the comments description and we can

3:11:48

help you out with that too So thanks so much for watching I appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one In this

3:11:54

free AI agents course you're going to learn how to basically automate anything using AI agents Now one of the first

3:12:01

tools that we're going to kick this off with is N8N This can build seriously powerful AI agents In fact your only

3:12:08

limit is your imagination Let me show you exactly what what I've worked on and we'll start with the basics and then

3:12:13

we'll get more and more advanced as we go through We're going to be talking about how to use Gemini DeepSeek Chat

3:12:20

GBT agents how to insert feedback loops human approval loops even how to for

3:12:26

example browse the web and scrape the web with AI agents and even some of my best workflows including AI avatars web

3:12:34

scraping sales agents etc Super excited to show you everything that exists inside here Now if you just want to get

3:12:40

started with the basics and you can just go inside NAT click create workflow and

3:12:46

from here you can add a step which is an AI agent right and basically what you're

3:12:51

doing inside NA you're essentially creating workflows that link AI APIs

3:12:56

using these workflows you can build all sorts of complex custom agents that you

3:13:02

would have never found before Now I'll show you some example workflows in a minute but this how it works Now usually

3:13:07

when you're building out these AI agents you want to have a trigger So this could be for example like a telegram message

3:13:13

It could be a WhatsApp message It could be just adding a chat inside the chat down here So you can talk with your AI

3:13:18

agent directly All right Now once you've done that you're going to add a row to an AI agent like you can see And inside

3:13:25

this AI agent you can just give different directions Now you got two choices here You can number one take the

3:13:31

prompt from the chat trigger or you can define the prompt that you want Right So

3:13:37

if I go into the chat I can set that as a trigger and that could be the prompt for the AI agent or what I can do is I

3:13:43

can click on define below and take the input inside the chat over here plug that into the text or just change it to

3:13:49

something like you are a friendly assistant Right And then what you can also do is you can have a system message

3:13:55

So a system message is like giving instructions on who that agent is And this way it knows exactly what its role

3:14:02

is how it can use how it's using its AI what is is basically its main priority

3:14:07

All right So once you set up your AI agent then you can go inside the chat model here and you've got all these

3:14:14

choices of AI So you can use for example Anthropic Azour Deepseek Google Gemini

3:14:20

Gemini is actually free You can grab an API from aistic studio.com and then plug that for free directly into Google

3:14:27

Gemini You could use grock That's also got some free options Mistral alarm is free That's hosted locally Open router

3:14:34

openai Now to keep things really simple I'm going to use open router And the reason for that is because you get

3:14:40

access to all these different APIs directly inside it Right So if you select open router and you plug in your

3:14:45

credentials here just click on the dropown go to create new credential then you can plug in your API key Now if

3:14:52

you're wondering okay how do you get an API key from open router just go to open router dot you're going to sign into your account or create one and once

3:14:58

you've done that just go down to your settings in the top so hover over your profile picture click on keys and then

3:15:06

from here you can create your API key that you're going to plug into NA10 And the good thing is once this is set up

3:15:12

every workflow you create is already plugged in and ready to go So you've got access to all these different APIs

3:15:17

directly in here If you want to go free if you want to go on a budget for example you can actually just type in

3:15:22

free on the model section and choose between all these different options So you've got Deepseek there Google Gemini

3:15:28

Flash Experimental Llama Llama is very fast Not many people know or use it And

3:15:33

you got Quen as well which is another Chinese AI from Alibaba So for example we can just go with Deepseek chat for

3:15:39

example or flashlight preview and then we're good to go on that All right so that's our AI plugged into the agent Now

3:15:44

this agent won't work without adding a chat model Of course you've always got to add that And inside the tool section

3:15:50

over here you can select between all the different apps and tools that you want to select right So for example you could

3:15:56

insert a tool like HTTPS This would basically scrape the internet right So it can scrape the internet based on the

## Connecting AI Agents to Multiple Tools

3:16:02

URLs you give it and it can just read live web pages You can also for example

3:16:08

connect this to Gmail So if we type in Gmail on the tools over here we've got the Gmail tool We could plug in an extra

3:16:13

tool You don't have to have one tool as well You can plug this into multiple places So you could for example link a

3:16:19

superbase database We could add inside here Tin right and look at our LinkedIn

3:16:24

profile And you can see all these different branches of tools that we can build in here We could also add Twitter and then we can link our AI agent to

3:16:31

multiple different apps I'll show you how to connect these later in the video But essentially that's what you can do

## Setting Up AI Agent Memory

3:16:36

with the power of this Now inside the memory section here this basically gives the AI agent recognition of all the

3:16:42

other stuff that you've created So if we click on window buffer memory this is by far the easiest to set up And once

3:16:49

you've set that up you can basically read previous interactions that you've had with AI agents The agent has a

3:16:55

memory of your interactions with the chat box Now that's useful because the more context your AI agent has of how

3:17:00

you like to interact with it the better the outputs of what you get from that AI agent So we could add for example like

3:17:07

10 different messages and this would read 10 past interactions with the model

3:17:13

and it would look at those as context of what we've done so far And if you want to delete any of this just rightclick

3:17:18

the module or just click on the bin at the top there And there you go All right

## Building and Testing Your AI Agent

3:17:24

Now if you wanted to test this workflow out this is basically how to build your own AI agent custom built to what you

3:17:30

want in literally a couple of seconds in literally a few clicks like you can see today Then we can say "Okay are you

3:17:35

working?" And that's going to trigger the AI agent to work And it's "Okay I will be a friendly assistant How can I

3:17:40

help you today?" All right And so you've built your first AI agent in the space of a few clicks Very simple And also the

3:17:47

API didn't cost you anything because we're using Google 2.0 flashlight preview Bear in mind like when you're

3:17:54

using some of these APIs if you're using a reason model you're going to get slower responses And I wouldn't

3:17:59

recommend if you need quick responses or you want a quick workflow I would recommend just using an API for example

3:18:04

flashlight preview that seems to get much faster responses without the deep thinking mode All right so something to

3:18:10

bear in mind as well Otherwise what you're going to have is like a chain of thought in the reply which is quite timeconuming quite annoying etc Now if

## Creating a Chatbot with Your AI Agent

3:18:18

you want to for example turn this AI agent into a chatbot right So you don't want to use it inside NA10 directly But

3:18:24

you do want to use it as a chatbot You can just visit anytime Then you can click on active over here So you can

3:18:30

make your workflow active And then inside the chat message you can click on make chat publicly available That will

3:18:36

give you a URL that you can navigate to Then we're going to go back over here We'll hit save on this And now we can

3:18:42

navigate to our chat Right So this is the URL we got from NA10 We got our chatbot ready to go We can say "Are you

3:18:47

working?" And it's great I'm ready to help in a friendly way What can I do for you today All right That was so easy to

3:18:52

set up an AI agent custom build to whatever you want Now if we hide the chat and then if you want to know how to

3:18:58

like scroll you can just press command and that will help you scroll to the left or to the right Inside the chat

3:19:04

here you can also add a more complex system message You can actually take the

3:19:09

inputs from the previous workflow For example we can take the chat input and then put that as a prompt that it works

3:19:15

with over here So we've dragged that in You see how it says JSON.put That is the

3:19:20

input from the previous workflow and that previous step is the chat like we

3:19:25

can see And then you can also choose whether you want like a conversational agent a tools agent all sorts of

3:19:31

different agents there And inside the settings as well you can see all these different options you get as well right

3:19:36

So you can say stop workflow on the error or continue and just pass a message on and carry on And then for the next output you can actually link the

3:19:43

output to another AI So you can have different AI agents with different roles or what you can do in here is you can

3:19:49

say okay send this message that we got from the AI agent over to Twitter right Whatever you want So that is the basics

3:19:56

of setting up an AI agent inside 10 It's going to get a lot more complex all the

3:20:01

way to the point where you're building stuff like this where you got positive feedback loops You got like four

3:20:07

different agents in one single workflow is working with Gmail and it's got filters for the messages you send

3:20:13

whether stuff is approved or declined and you got multiple different AIs and APIs working together like you can see

3:20:18

We're going to cover that later in this course But for now if you want to know how to do web scraping inside what you

## Web Scraping with AI Agents

3:20:24

can do is you can connect a key request and this will look at your live website So for example we've plugged in

3:20:31

julianoldie.com as the URL to get and then that's going to send over to our AI agent And you can see as the prompt

3:20:38

inside this AI agent we said rewrite the copy on this page plus make it more interesting and fun Add some emojis and

3:20:44

write it in HTML as a beautifully designed landing page All right Now if

3:20:49

you wanted to test out we can go over to the chat here We can say get started And basically what this is going to do is

3:20:56

it's going to scrape the web So it scraped my homepage and it's taking that live data and now it's using that to

3:21:02

create the HTML And the output that we get back from the AI agent is going to be available once the workflow is done

3:21:09

Right And you can move the chat up or down like that Just click on the arrows pointing up and down So we'll wait for

3:21:14

that to load and I'll show you what you can do with this So for example you could take live data from the web You could take headlines You could use that

3:21:21

as research You could also for example use it to create your own website Anything that you can do with a web

3:21:26

scraper you can now plug that straight into AI agent and you're ready to go on And I think this is super powerful to

3:21:32

know because a lot of people love these AI tools but most of them are based on outdated data right You got stuff like

3:21:39

for example Claude that's outdated You got these other AI tools that are outdated whereas this can plug live into

3:21:45

the internet So we've got the HTML here to preview If you go on to liveweave.com we can preview the HTML that's rewritten

3:21:52

from our main homepage So I'm just going to delete the previous stuff that was here Plug that in And we've got our

3:21:57

landing page recreated like all right And that was based on the live page that

3:22:02

we have over here Right There's no CSS in this but there is the HTML content which is what we've rewritten with the

3:22:08

AI on autopilot When you're doing all this stuff your only limit is your imagination I've seen some absolutely

## Automating Content Creation with AI

3:22:14

mind-blowing workflows that I never actually thought was possible And honestly you can create something that's

3:22:20

better than a SAS tool Like you can create your own startup SAS in the space of minute You get faster and faster as

3:22:26

you use this more And additionally it's all personalized to you and your situation I not code I don't understand

3:22:32

code but I can easily build an AI agent that does And I can create a team that's almost like a team of employees working

3:22:39

together but instead of waiting days or weeks for the work to get done it gets done in one click like you see today So

3:22:45

with that let's get straight into the rest of the course I'm going to show you how to build AI agents using Gemini 2.0

## Setting Up AI Agents with Gemini 2.0

3:22:51

completed for free So first thing you want to do is go over to n10 get your free trial for 2 weeks and then also

3:22:56

from there you're going to grab a free API key Now the way to do that is you are going to go to a google.com then

3:23:02

you're going to go to get API key From here you're going to click on create API key and this is completely free and you

3:23:08

can just click create an API key Right once you've done that you can actually plug that into an AI agent workflow like

3:23:15

you can see inside NA10 Now I'll give you access to all of the tutorials and templates from today inside the AI

3:23:21

profit bordering but essentially what you can see here is we've got an AI agent ready to go plugged in We've

3:23:27

tested are you working It is working It's beautiful It's easy And it's very simple to create these one-click AI

3:23:33

agents for free Let me show you exactly how we set it up step by step Delete that We'll start from scratch just for

3:23:39

you people at home watching We're going to click on add a new step now And inside the AI workflow you want to make

3:23:44

sure that you have AI agents set up right Or what you can also do is just add a first step And if you want to

3:23:50

trigger the workflow with a chat trigger so for example when you chat to your AI then you can easily do that using this

3:23:55

method right here So what you can see is you're building out an agentic workflow and it's really simple and easy inside

3:24:01

NA10 and you just click on AI agent right So you can connect different apps

3:24:06

and automate a lot of different things using this autonomous AI agent right So if we click on AI agent so it's going to

3:24:13

connect it over here we've got the options I'll come on to exactly how to set that up in a second but essentially

3:24:19

when a chat message received that will trigger the AI agent And then inside the chat model over here you want to select

3:24:25

Google and we're going to select Google Gemini chat model so that we can use the latest Now if you're wondering okay how

3:24:30

do you connect the API that you got from Gemini inside here right So the way that

3:24:36

you do that create a new credential and inside the Google Gemini account section here you can leave the host as the

3:24:42

default and then plug in your API key which again you get from AI Studio Click get API key create API key and then you

3:24:48

can plug that in Pretty simple stuff Now the good thing is once it's set up inside NAM you got your credentials

3:24:55

saved they're ready to go You can select them anytime Now the important thing here is that you're not going to use the default model selected So it's going to

3:25:01

start off with Gemini 1.0 Pro Obviously you don't want that you want to go for 2.0 and the latest model So you can see

3:25:09

here we've got different dates on the releases So if we look at the dropown for example we've got like 2.0 flash

3:25:15

experimental 2.0 flash which is great But we want the ones that have just been updated on February the 5th So for

3:25:21

example we've got Gemini 2.0 flashlight preview and Gemini 2.0 flashlight

3:25:26

preview 5th of February All right so those are the two that you want to focus on So we'll go with this one for now And

3:25:32

that is ready to go and set up If you want to just test that it works once you've added your API key and the chat

3:25:37

trigger then you can go inside the chat and just say are you working just to double check okay is this actually

3:25:42

working is it have we got the AI assistant ready to go and if it's set up correctly with the right API key and

3:25:48

everything else then it'll say okay yes I'm working I'm an AI and always ready to assist okay all right once we've done

3:25:53

that if you want to just reset the workspace and zoom out a bit then I press command zero that just zooms me

3:25:59

out and now we can zoom out and look at everything now from here what you can actually do is just connect tools So you

3:26:04

don't just have to set this up as a standalone chatbot You can for example like connect different apps different tools over here And this is super useful

3:26:11

because now the AI agent can take the data from whatever tools you connect and then you can easily feed in that

## Creating SEO Optimized Content with AI

3:26:18

information So let's say for example you want to create a AI content creator using Gemini We can take this prompt

3:26:25

right here that I use for creating content We're going to plug that into our AI agent And inside the add option

3:26:32

section down here we're going to select systems message And instead of having

3:26:38

the default which is you are a helpful assistant we're going to switch that now to create an SEO optimized article for

3:26:43

this keyword equals the keyword I give you We're going to test that step now So

3:26:48

if we go inside the chat and we'll say keyword equals what is SEO Now going to

3:26:54

write that content for us Right So you see here we've got the whole article ready to go And this is all customized

3:27:00

to the prompt we plugged in earlier So you can see it's actually created a full article How long is that That's a

3:27:06

thousand words with one little prompt We just give it the keyword and it does everything else So it's like why is this

3:27:11

And the content itself was written really nicely But you can see here how you can optimize blog content SEO

3:27:17

content Twitter content whatever you want Even YouTube scripts you could easily do And it's written it really

3:27:22

nicely As you can see it's also formatted it super nicely And we've got bullet points We've got SEO optimized

3:27:28

content And here's the other thing as well It's actually personalized all the content And bear in mind this is free

3:27:34

right This is not costing you anything because you're using the free API from Google and you're using the free trial

3:27:40

from NAN And if you don't like it then you can get rid of it after two weeks If it doesn't get you the ROI right And you

3:27:45

get expert help Look SEO can be complex My agency has done this If you want to

3:27:51

join the SEO lead circle go here If you want to book in a call go here here And if we click on that it's created a

3:27:57

personalized link to our funnels Right So we've easily automated personalized content that's better than most humans

3:28:04

can write Nicely formatted and ready to go into blog And if we actually hide that chat now we can select this to go

3:28:10

out to a blog or a Shopify blog Right So if we type in Shopify you can connect this to your e-commerce store If you

3:28:16

want to automate blog content or if you want to automate content on WordPress you can just click on WordPress right there Let's have a look if it's got web

3:28:22

flow as well I know a few people switched into that recently including authority hackers Saw that recently So

3:28:28

yeah you can connect this to Web Flow as well And then you can just automate really high quality content personalized

3:28:33

to you with all your internal links in And boom shackle you've done it for free using the free API from Google AI Studio

3:28:39

Crazy stuff Now if we type in WordPress over here we're going to click WordPress Then we're going to click on create a

3:28:45

post And from here we can select what we want to do So we can say resource post

3:28:51

operation create title We can put as what is SEO or whatever your keyword is

3:28:58

And then inside the add field section here you're going to add your content and you can add a slug as well So I'm

3:29:04

just going to delete slug for now cuz I don't want to manually fill it in And then for the content itself you can just grab the output like so And what I'm

3:29:11

actually going to do inside the AI agent as well is I'm going to say write this as boom All right And what that's going

3:29:17

to do using the chat feature is just create super personalized content with internal links nicely written for free

3:29:23

in literally a minute and then send it over to WordPress Super easy Crazy how

3:29:28

powerful this is right So let's just test this works All right I'm just going to log into WordPress Happy days And

3:29:36

then we need to link the chat message to the AI agent that was unlin a second ago I'm going to go over to the chat I'm

3:29:42

going to refresh the chat Just delete all that and we'll say okay keyword equals SEO training Japan That's going

3:29:49

to write the content If we just lower that slightly so we can see what's happening So basically just to explain

3:29:56

the workflow in case you're unsure what's going on here Basically we've taken the chat message which is just

3:30:02

plugging in our keyword The AI agent the SEO AI agent is taking Google Gemini

3:30:08

taking our prompt which is keyword equals writing the content and then creating a post over at WordPress Now if

3:30:13

we go to WordPress we'll go into posts We've got the title of the article we

3:30:18

just created just here And if we click on preview boom Look at that So easy simple to do How long did that take

3:30:26

Literally just one single prompt plus a keyword We're ready to go off that Super powerful and easy to do And then it said

3:30:32

to us "Okay SEO training Japan You guys crushing it in the Japanese market." And the content itself super nicely written

3:30:37

Additionally what it's done is it's actually linked to our funnel pages where we want to send traffic and get

3:30:44

clients and it's personalized all the content to us as well Obviously you would edit it before you publish it This

3:30:50

is just a draft which is the beauty of this So you would quality control it before you publish it but you can create

3:30:55

free AI SEO agents that can create blog content or create social media content

3:31:00

and you can do it using Gemini Pro which is the latest model from Google Absolutely amazing So what we can also

3:31:07

do here is if we move this over here we'll move that over there We'll move this over here And what we're going to do from here is we're actually going to

## Advanced AI Agent Workflows

3:31:13

duplicate that AI agent And I'm going to unlink this So let's delete the link

3:31:19

between the AI agent and that And we're going to connect that to another AI agent right And so what this is doing

3:31:25

now is we're going to have Google Gemini over here as well Inside the Google Gemini chat model we're going to select

3:31:32

2.0 O and the February the 5th model So the latest version of Gemini And then

3:31:37

we're going to say inside this AI agent right which is totally different from this one This one's going to be for

3:31:43

writing content And this one's going to be for actually coming up with keywords And so I'm going to say inside this AI

3:31:50

agent when I ask you for a keyword give me a keyword that's related to my niche

3:31:57

One single keyword No other responses All right And what I'm looking for here

3:32:03

is like longtail localized simple eg SEO training Japan SEO training in London

3:32:10

All right And you can plug this prompt in however you want I'm just doing this for speed Obviously it's a YouTube video

3:32:16

We're not going to go too in depth on that But basically what we're trying to do here is we're going to ask for a

3:32:21

keyword that's going to run through the keyword agent And I'm just going to rename this agent SEO keyword agent

## Integrating AI Agents with WordPress

3:32:29

Rename that And then inside this agent this is actually going to be our SEO content writer agent Right And so now we

3:32:37

can automate the keyword send that over to our content writer agent and then send that over to WordPress in one

3:32:43

smooth workflow Now inside here what you're going to do is you're going to execute the previous nodes All right So I'm going to click on play over here

3:32:49

Then we're going to open this up and we're going to take the output from the

3:32:54

previous keyword agent and plug that into our SEO content writer agent So if I take the output we're going to take

3:32:59

that and we'll plug it into the keyword section over here All right And so now

3:33:04

every time this agent runs I'm going to say pick one keyword from this Use that

3:33:10

to write the article Okay So now basically what it's going to do is it's going to pick one keyword from the

3:33:16

outputs of our SEO keyword agent and it's going to use that to write the article So if we go back to the keyword

3:33:21

agent now we just need to really give it some clear instructions on exactly what it needs And so I'm going to put that

3:33:28

inside the chat input which is our prompt into the chat and say based on this when I ask you for a keyword give

3:33:33

me one single keyword that's relevant to my niche one single keyword no other

3:33:39

keywords This will be used for an AI agent to write an article Okay Longtail

3:33:46

localized simple gio training fan SEO training London And you can personalize

3:33:51

this prompt to your niche whatever I want to show you how personalized you can make it We'll say okay now SEO train

3:33:57

in Dubai All right we'll put examples of keywords equals this Okay so now we're

3:34:02

going to test that step and you can see here the output So it's giving us an output here And so if we go into our

3:34:08

chat model we'll refresh the chat So reset the session I'm just going to hit save on that as well So we can save our

3:34:14

progress And if we run the whole workflow now I'm going to run the chat I'm going to say okay my niche equals

3:34:22

SEO agency And just going back to the SEO content writer agent So if you want to edit that click on that You want to

3:34:29

define change the source for prompt from connected chat trigger mode to define

3:34:34

below And so now put keyword equals and that's going to be the chat trigger for

3:34:39

our SEO content writer agent Right So it's all linked together And now we're going to test it So I'm going to say my

3:34:45

niche equals SEO agency That's gone straight through the keyword agent Lightning fast Now it's writing the

3:34:50

content and that should plug over to WordPress So we'll just go back over to

3:34:56

our post inside WordPress now And we've got the article ready to go So let's

3:35:01

click on preview and boom Look at that Right The AI picked out the article for us the keyword All we had to do was tell

3:35:08

it our niche right And it did everything else Now if we go over to WordPress and the output here now that we've got the

3:35:14

keywords from the keyword node we can actually plug those into the title because that's picking the keyword for

3:35:19

us which is the title And also if we add the field here we can select slug And then inside the slug we can also put the

3:35:25

keyword from the AI agent So if we just grab that we'll plug that in And if you understand what we're doing here I'm

3:35:32

flying through it because obviously it's a YouTube video and this could be like an hour long but essentially what we're doing here is we are literally

3:35:39

automating our whole SEO strategy Not just the content not just the publishing

3:35:44

not just the keyword research Literally all we need to do is just go here's my niche The AI agent will figure out the

3:35:50

keyword Then the AI agent will figure out the content and then it's going to send it to WordPress So let's try that

3:35:56

workflow again I've already shown you it works but I want to show you something else now So we're going to click off that and we'll refresh the chat So reset

3:36:04

that And then inside here I can say for example okay niche equals SEO agency

3:36:10

We'll head into So that's feeding into the keyword agent Now it's feeding into the content writer agent And boom we've

3:36:16

just sent that to WordPress ASM N is by far the best platform the easiest

3:36:22

platform to use once you get your head around that I started using this like two weeks ago properly I actually

3:36:27

started testing out about a year and a half ago Couldn't get my head around it and now it is absolutely amazing So you

3:36:33

can see here we've got a nicely formatted article It's all personalized to us We didn't even have to think about the keyword that we're going for and the

3:36:41

AI has come up with a keyword come up with the content personalized it to us sent it to WordPress created a draft and

3:36:48

that is absolutely amazing Now this can be an infinite workflow right So you don't just have to send this to

3:36:53

WordPress If you wanted you could add another action in that So if you click here you can actually send this over to

3:37:00

Twitter as well And you could for example like create a tweet right And you could automate all your social media

3:37:05

content not just your SEO content You could even for example like create a video script for that and then send that

3:37:11

over to whatever your favorite AI video content creator is But the main thing about this is you are creating an

3:37:16

absolutely amazing workflow based on this AI agent So what I'm actually going to do is I will take the workflow from

3:37:22

today the JSON file and if you want to import that into NAT yourself so you can import the JSON then what I'll do is I'm

3:37:29

going to plug this into the AI profit boardroom If you go to SAPs we'll add a new page autonomous Gemini 2.0 AI agents

3:37:38

and we'll call that Gemini 2.0 AICO agent likes All right And also what I'll do is I'll take the transcript from

3:37:44

## Using DeepSeek for AI Automation

3:39:02

Today I'm going to show you how to build oneclick DeepSk AI agents using a new workflow I've never shown before So what

3:39:08

we're going to do is first place you're going to start is at nat10.io and then once you're logged in you're going to go to create workflow and over here you're

3:39:15

going to add a new step Now inside this new step what we're going to do is we're going to click on chat trigger and that

3:39:20

will trigger a automation based on the actual chat Right You can even make this publicly available if you want so you

3:39:25

can share it with people that sort of thing And by the way I will give you the blueprint at the end of this video So

3:39:30

make sure you keep watching if you just want to steal this workflow from me Now from here what we're going to do is inside this workflow we're going to

3:39:36

click on AI agent right So if we click on the plus sign we can now create an AI agent using DeepSeek and we can trigger

3:39:43

that to run our automations So we've set up the chat trigger which means the automation will start as soon as we

3:39:50

start chatting with the AI agent How do you start chatting You just click on chat down at the bottom And then how do

3:39:55

you add DeepS to the AI agent Now at this point we need to connect DeepSeek How do we do that So if you're using an

3:40:03

older version of NASA like me we need to update the workspace So what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that

3:40:09

we update this hit save changes the workspace will go offline for a minute or two But then if we go back to our dashboard once that's updated which will

3:40:16

just take a minute then we can get back into the game All right So that was super quick and literally took about a

3:40:21

minute So from here what we're going to do is we're going to go back into the workflow All right And once you're back

3:40:27

in your workflow you're just going to hit on chat model There's two ways you can implement deepseeek right So they actually have a deepseek chat model

3:40:33

where you can plug in the API directly or what you can do is you can plug in open router Now the beauty of open

3:40:38

router is that you can actually add in your credentials right here and just get an API key from open router So if we go

3:40:45

to keys over here and click create key then create your API key like so Once you've added a new credential plug your

3:40:50

API key hit save That's going to say connection tested successfully Once you've done that you can actually flick

3:40:55

between many different models right So you don't have to be limited to just Deep Seek But if you do want to use Deepseek then you actually get access to

3:41:02

R1 Distilled Llama which is a distilled version of Deepseek R1 and that's completely free And additionally you get

3:41:08

access to deepseat chat for free as well right And you can have DeepSeek R1 for free as well So you can leverage the

3:41:15

power of Deepseek and its API completely for free And you can between many different models We've got Mistro Nvidia

3:41:20

Open Chat Quen etc And so it's crazy what you get and how you can use it for free For example if we select DC chat

3:41:27

like we now have that plugged into our AI agent So if we go into chat and just check it works we'll say are you working

3:41:32

That's going to trigger the automation and we can see if open router is actually working or not Inside here we

3:41:37

can test the AI agent If we just say are you working We've got that running like

3:41:42

so AI agent running through open router using DeepSeek and that chat model is

3:41:47

working right there Now I've selected deepseat chat You can choose whatever you want but that's basically how it works step by step Right now what we can

3:41:54

do is inside the tool section we can connect this to many different apps and also we can give custom instructions to

3:42:01

the AI agent So if we delete that we're going to refresh the chat here and we'll hide that chat What we're going to do

3:42:06

from here is we're going to select add option system message We're going to say inside here using a previous prompt that

3:42:13

I've used for creating video transcript blogs We're going to plug this directly into the system message over here And

3:42:18

basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a AI agent that can basically take the transcripts from my

3:42:25

videos and then turn that into a blog post ranks for SEO Now you might say okay why would you do that Actually a

3:42:30

lot of my transcripts written with AI are actually ranking really well You can see for example all this traffic that we're getting with potential leads for

3:42:38

our relevant keywords that you want to get on Google right So here's a keyword here's a page and these pages are

3:42:43

written with AI using the transcript from our video example right here The same for example inside perplexity as

3:42:50

well We can rank our videos but also our blog content inside these AI search engines Get more customers that way Now

3:42:56

what you can also do is we can delete this model right here So let's delete that and we can stop the whole workflow

3:43:02

and then we can actually add deepsee directly in here as well So if click on deepse chat model then we're going to

3:43:08

add a credential from deepseek directly So it's gone to deepsee to the API

3:43:14

platform This is available at platform.dec.com Then we're going to go over to API keys Create a new API key

3:43:20

And then inside the credentials here we can just add those in As you can see hit save That's connected Nice and easy

3:43:28

Inside the AI agent we've got the same prompt same system message etc And we can take the chat input inside the

3:43:35

system message section We'll plug that into the top So now the system messages using this input which is a video

3:43:41

transcript When I paste in my video transcript write part one of the article Right Then we're going to test this step

3:43:47

And then you can see here for example I did simplify the prompt just to make it faster for the sake of this demo video

3:43:53

But you can see here we say create a blog from my video transcript that I give you And then inside the response

3:43:59

here it's given us a video transcript We plug that into a new document We've got the blog ready to go right there Let's

3:44:06

have a look at that So it's taken that transcript and then created a nice little block So really simple to create

3:44:11

these AI agents And then what we can actually do is we can actually create multiple different AI agents and feed

3:44:17

them together Right So if we click on AI agent over here this is going to take the input from the source prompt Then

3:44:23

we're going to add the system message Write the second part of this article like so This will just carry along in a

3:44:31

long line Now we're going to link this back to open router Again you can use deepsee if you want to We'll select open

3:44:36

router for now Then we will select deepse chat DC chat is a lot faster and it's better for writing content You will

3:44:43

get the output but you will also get the thinking and reasoning behind that output which is not very useful So

3:44:50

what's better to use is the Deep Seek version 3 which is the chat model right here So what we've got over here is an

3:44:56

AI agent that's programmed to create content and then another AI agent and

3:45:02

you can link these both to DeepSeek inside these modules here so that you can write part one and part two of your

3:45:07

article Right So for example if we open up this AI agent you can see here we've got tools agent Then we've put source

3:45:14

for the prompt defined below And then we said based on my video transcript that I paste in create a blog and basically

3:45:20

this chat input is the chat transcript that I would take from dcript So I've

3:45:26

got my video transcript right here And then I've taken that and plugged it directly into the chat It's what's going

3:45:32

to form part of the prompt So this bit is dynamic and it changes every single time you write a prompt Now inside the

3:45:38

system message these are the instructions on how to write the article how to prompt it etc How to get the best

3:45:44

out of it right And so what we're going to do is we're going to call this transcript one part one and then we'll

3:45:51

call this one part two So we got part one and part two and then what we can actually do is so we take the

3:45:56

transcripts like so and then we're going to link this to WordPress Create a post I've already got my WordPress credentials plugged in right there We'll

3:46:04

just call this example one just so you can see how it works And then inside the content section we are going to take the

3:46:10

transcript from part one Now inside the WordPress section what we're actually going to do is take the outputs right

3:46:16

from the AI agent So we got transcript part two and you can just drag and drop

3:46:22

that into the output section over here And what that will do is actually take the outputs and plug them over into

3:46:28

WordPress So let's test this step like and you can see it's worked nicely Now if we refresh the page we've got the

3:46:35

preview ready to go So if we click on preview this is the example And you can see we got the content from the page And

3:46:41

actually it's pretty long right That's all personalized to the transcript that we plugged in If we check the word

3:46:46

counter it's 1,200 words However there's an issue here because what you can actually see is that it's written in

3:46:52

markdown right So you got these hashtags and all that sort of thing So what you would do inside the prompts earlier in

3:46:57

the workflow if we go back to NASA now we'll press escape to get out of there And inside here we're going to say okay

3:47:03

output HTML So output in HTML And we'll do the same inside part two as well

3:47:10

There we go And that's just going to make it better formatting for when it goes over to WordPress So if we go back

3:47:16

inside the chat now and we'll test this out So I'm going to grab this transcript So plug that into the chat hit enter

3:47:24

that's going to run the automation nicely And now it's on to part two of

3:47:29

the transcript and it's writing the content and then it's pulling it over to WordPress So if we refresh WordPress now

3:47:35

we can preview this and that's running over to WordPress now Now the one thing

3:47:41

I want to say over here is that inside the chat right if you're loading in something quite big like a long article

3:47:48

complex like you can see right here you got multiple chains inside the steps multiple agents working together like

3:47:54

these transcript agents then you can use other APIs right for example if you find

3:47:59

like deepseeek is too slow for you then you could use something like mistrout which is super fast or you could use

3:48:05

Google flash thinking right so it depends what you optimize it for so we're just going to refresh the page page Now we have the preview ready to go

3:48:12

Let's open this bad boy up And now we have the content ready to go Like you can see it's all updated even as a CTA

3:48:19

to join the free AO accelerator which is our Facebook group This is all customized to us Nicely formatted ready

3:48:26

to go And obviously you would quality control it before you publish it but you get the idea You could also delete that

3:48:31

and you could add like a different app So for example if we type in apps over here So if we click the plus sign we can

3:48:36

actually type in for example like Google Docs You could output that to Google Docs If you actually wanted to publish

3:48:42

it directly to LinkedIn they do have this LinkedIn tool and then you can click create a post and if you want to

3:48:47

delete any modules that you add you can do that too But yeah super powerful and simple Now also based on this what we

3:48:53

can do is we can click on advanced agent set up another deepseek module right

3:48:59

here and this can be our keyword agent right so let's say for example if we add open router select deepseek this can be

3:49:06

our keyword agent that basically finds a relevant keyword and title for our article so we'll click on define below

3:49:14

inside this module then we're going to grab the output from the transcript and I'm going to say suggest a relevant SEO

3:49:21

keyword for the article below should be short relevant plus SEO optimized Okay

3:49:28

let's test that And it's given us the output but you can see and I think it's good for you to see this So for example

3:49:33

like Deepseek AI tutorial but the problem with this is it's giving us multiple and it's giving us a lot of fluff around it Whereas we just want the

3:49:40

title and I'll show you why in a second cuz basically what we're going to do is plug this into WordPress So I'm going to say don't give me anything else but the

3:49:48

keyword And it should be one single keyword idea All right pick the best one

3:49:55

Now we're going to test it out And the good thing about this is you can test the steps You can see what you think You can try out each stage of the progress

3:50:02

before you get what you want Okay so for example it's come back to us with Deepseek AI automation workflow Perfect

3:50:07

We just don't want any quote marks Let's test it out again And the better you get your prompts the less you need to edit

3:50:12

the content and the outputs later right So the more time you spend on the prompts now the less time you have to

3:50:18

waste later getting best outers So you can see here for example we've gone from a massive paragraph to five different

3:50:23

keyword ideas to one single keyword idea but it had a hyphen and quote marks to like a title and a keyword that's ready

3:50:30

to go Boom Right now if we zoom out of this workflow we're going to go back into WordPress And what we're going to

3:50:36

do over here is we're going to take the keyword output and we're going to plug that into the title Right We'll delete the previous title which was example one

3:50:43

We don't need that And also inside here we're going to add a field called slug Inside the slug we'll grab the output

3:50:50

and that's going to be the URL of our rascal So using that keyword stage we've

3:50:55

now got a title and a URL for our article So for example like

3:51:02

julianoldie.com/deseekai automation Now I saw a YouTube comment the other day that was asking should you ask it to

3:51:08

come up with an SEO title and a meta description and all that I don't bother with all that right I want to make this

3:51:13

as optimized and as fast as possible And bear in mind like 50% of the time Google when it comes to SEO is just going to

3:51:18

come up with a rewritten metad description based on the content So most of the time you don't need to specify a

3:51:24

meta description Most of the time as long as the keyword is relevant you're good to go We've got that automation looking really good Now you might ask

3:51:31

well like why would you have two different sections for the transcript right If you're writing one single article the problem with that is if you

3:51:38

just have one section it's just going to write 400 words 500 words the article is not going to be long or as in depth as

3:51:44

as is required for a good article So it's better to have two different steps Get the article and the research and the

3:51:51

depth you need Get the keyword so that you can filter that to WordPress And the cool thing about this is it's all set up

3:51:57

and ready to go now So every time I create a video I can create a nice transcript that's just ready to go over

3:52:03

and over again Every time I return to this workflow it saves me so much time And we're absolutely flying So now let's

3:52:09

test this all out together I'm just going to make sure I save this Always save your progress on L 10 Otherwise

3:52:14

when you back out the workflow it's not going to be there for you anymore Then if you want to change the name of your workflow like for example video

3:52:20

transcript creator you just basically do that Now if we go back to the chat and you want to delete the history you can

3:52:26

reset the history likes And then we can just plug in a video transcript It's creating part one Now it's generating

3:52:32

part two Seems to be going pretty smoothly so far Now we've got the keyword generating and that's gone to

3:52:38

WordPress Wow Now you might be saying as well okay but why not just use like one of those SEO tools that you can build AI

3:52:44

with or why not just use chat GPT But the thing is the whole point of this is it's an automation right So you

3:52:50

literally just paste a transcript and it customizes everything to you your business plugs it into WordPress saves

3:52:55

you a lot of time inserts your internal links writes it in HTML writes it exactly how you want it using the API

3:53:02

that you want to use and gives you so much freedom over the process so much control and the best possible outputs

3:53:08

you can get So if we go to the article we've got the title right there with the keyword which is and it's chosen

3:53:14

DeepSeek AI agent techniques automation has finished running through like you can see Perfect Now if you refresh the

3:53:22

post section on WordPress we can click on preview on the latest article and it's picked the title So the keyword

3:53:29

tools agent has then plugged in the title right there So we've got the SEO optimized keyword title Additionally

3:53:35

that's going to be the slug of the article as well when we publish it Then we've got a nicely written article that said "Want to build killer content fast

3:53:42

Ever wondered how to automate your content creation using AI." Then you've come to the right place I'm going to show you how to build oneclick deepseek

3:53:47

AI agents using a workflow that can seriously streamline your content process And then you see it says "Watch

3:53:52

the video tutorial below." And you just insert the URL that you want to embed Everything is nicely set up as well As

3:53:59

you can see it's all nicely formatted And additionally it's linked out to our funnels right So for example this is all

3:54:05

customized to us our brand It's given us some it's insert some nice techniques how to maximize efficiency AI tools and

3:54:13

then also a CTA at the end plus some FAQs again and that was super simple and easy to do Now before you publish of

3:54:19

course you want to always quality control anything that is client facing in your business So I've got a checklist

3:54:24

that I'll include inside the AI profit boardroom along with the workflow from today But that's basically how you can

3:54:31

build like deepsek AI agents So you can customize it to whatever you want So today for example I wanted to create an

3:54:36

AI agent that could take my video transcripts into SEO optimized articles But basically any repetitive process

3:54:42

that you're using day in day out you can now automate using DeepSeek and it's

3:54:48

very linear Plus it's just like drag and drop You there's no coding involved here It's absolutely amazing The other thing

3:54:54

I tend to find is it's a lot simpler and breaks less than Zapia Zapia constantly gives you errors and make.com is a lot

3:55:01

more complicated to set up a lot more things can go wrong Whereas NATO once you get your head around it it's just absolutely amazing It's it's really

3:55:08

powerful Now some other cool stuff as well you can do If we go back to the chat trigger over here we can actually

3:55:14

click on make chat publicly available If we select that URL is now ready for us

3:55:20

to just start using as a chatbot plugged into our NAN automation right And then

3:55:26

you can change the initial message here So for example you can say "Hi there What's the video transcript you want to

3:55:34

use You can have an authentication as well So if you want to password protect that you can Then if we save that click

3:55:39

on the URL You can see inside the chat here is hi there What's the video transcript you want to use And then you

3:55:45

just plug in the video transcript that you want to create content from As an example of that we've just pasted in this video transcript It's running the

3:55:52

automation like so We just wait for that to roll out And then once that automation is finished it will plug it

3:55:58

into WordPress It's pretty simple and easy to use So I'm just going to unselect And then if you don't want it

## Making Chat Publicly Available

3:56:03

to be available anymore just deselect make chat publicly available Yeah that's basically it Now what you could even do

## Automating Content Creation with AI

3:56:10

is you could have another branch off here And you could say okay Twitter

3:56:15

create a tweet and then based on the video transcript that you created a blog around you could also for example like

3:56:21

create LinkedIn content or Twitter content or whatever platform you prefer to post on So there's loads and loads of

3:56:27

potential to this So much power But something like that would normally take me like 5 to 10 minutes going back and forth with Claude So for example like

3:56:34

normally I'm using this project inside Claude for creating blogs around my YouTube videos I can now easily automate

3:56:41

inside NA10 and the outputs are going to be 10 times better So crazy stuff So what I'm

## Downloading and Sharing JSON Files

3:56:46

actually going to do is I'm going to download the JSON file And if you want access to that I will plug that inside the classroom inside the SAPs And then

3:56:54

we'll add a new section called Deepseek AI agents And we can just upload a file here We'll call that video transcript

3:57:01

creator And then if you want access to that and my SEO checklist for quality controlling your content you can get that directly inside the AI profit

3:57:07

3:57:47

that link in the comments description Appreciate you watching These new Google Gemini 2.0 computer use Asians are

## Exploring Google Gemini 2.0

3:57:54

absolutely insane companies can basically go off use your laptop surf the internet do whatever task you want

3:58:00

to do automated in one click I'll show you exactly how So what you can see here is we've got the Len configuration as

3:58:06

the new model of Gemini So you can select which model of Gemini we want And

3:58:11

obviously the latest 2.0 update just came out within the last few days And if we go over to run agent we say okay go

3:58:17

to com and tell me where I can buy sleeves or my t-shirt All right And then

3:58:24

we'll hit run agent What this is going to go off and do like you can see over here if we open this up is it's now

3:58:30

going to start going off easy using Google automating whatever task we give it Literally just took one click right

3:58:36

so you can see I'm not holding doing anything I'm not typing anything and you can see how it's analyzing the page

3:58:42

because it highlights the different visual elements and then this okay let's figure out where we can get this man

3:58:47

sleeves for his t-shirt All right And he can even read for example Google maps And if we go over to the results section

3:58:54

over here not only do we have the latest recording from what we just did with the

3:58:59

agent right So you can see that's a 31 second recorded but also what you can see here is actually giving us the

3:59:04

details of where we can buy sleeves for our t-shirt All right absolutely amazing what you can do with 2025 This didn't

3:59:11

cost us a penny There's there's also some really cool new features for example like deep research and you can

3:59:16

also configure many different LMS right So you don't have to use Google if you don't want to I would say it's probably

3:59:21

the easiest one and I'll show you exactly how how to set up in a second and also you got a choice between open AAI appropic deep sea goo or llama as

3:59:28

well mist as well Now one of the best things about Google is not only that it's a very new model and not only it's

3:59:34

completely free but also it seems to work much better than something like deepse where typically if you use deepseeek as the API So if you select

3:59:41

deep seed down there the problem with that is it doesn't have vision right So it's not going to be able to analyze a

3:59:47

page And also if you're using Deep Seek R1 inside the chat right here the

3:59:53

problem with that is that if you're using the reason model then it's going to take a lot longer for the responses

3:59:58

because it's going to have to think in multiple steps before it takes any action Whereas if you give Gemini 2.0

4:00:04

Flash Experimental the job it's like boom let's go off and do our magic And all you need to do is plug in the API

4:00:10

key Now if you're wondering okay how do I get the API key Then you just go to

4:00:15

ai.studio.google.com and you can grab an API key completely for free here You just click create an API key That's it

4:00:21

Super works And then you plug that in down here You leave the endpoint blank and you get together And then you just

4:00:26

select whichever model you want And also you might be wondering okay but how do you actually get the browser use web UI

4:00:33

So here's the actual page and this is the GitHub right So you can install this locally That's another benefit to this

4:00:39

is if it's stored locally it's more private etc And also you can use your own custom browser right So it says you

4:00:45

can use your own browser without all eliminating the need to log in to sites or deal with other authentication

4:00:51

challenges This feature also supports highdeinition screen recording You can also choose to keep the browser window

4:00:57

open between AI tasks so it doesn't automatically complete it and you can see the history of AI interactions And

4:01:04

if you scroll down here they've got the steps on how to set it up locally Like you can see I'm running down here in the

4:01:11

terminal Right now if you want to see the exact steps on how I set it up I'll include that inside the AI profit

4:01:16

boardroom link in the comments description If you want the access to that we'll just go to classroom over here SP and you get all the video notes

4:01:23

from today directly in there So if you want to follow the instructions step by step we've got all the links and we've

4:01:28

got the details on how to set it up in the map along with all these other modules including our crash course plus

4:01:34

weekly coaching with me So let's get straight back into this link in the comments description to that AI profit

4:01:39

boardroom What we can also do over here is we can select deep research and we can actually create a deep research

## Using AI for Deep Research

4:01:45

report Now you might be wondering okay what does that even mean So inside chat GPT for example they have this deep

4:01:51

research option right You click that and it will take about 10 minutes to generate a very deep research report

4:01:56

that's absolutely amazing but it's going to cost you $2,400 per year because it's $200 per month for the chat GPT pro plan

4:02:04

which is where you get access to deep research Really good feature but expensive and unaffordable for a lot of

4:02:10

people right And so if you go to the deep research section in here you can actually use this for free and create a

4:02:15

deep research report using the API and you plug into browser use web UI Right

4:02:21

So you can see now it's beginning to do the research It's searching the web Right This is the other thing is it's connecting Google's Gemini 2.0 which is

4:02:28

not normally connected to the web and then it's going and it's doing all the research like you can see and it's just

4:02:33

browsing the web whilst we don't do anything And the other cool thing about this is if you have it open in a different window like you can see right

4:02:40

here So this is running on Chromium which is a totally separate browser to our main Chrome So it's like a a virtual

4:02:46

environment Then it's going to go off It's going to do the research You can do whatever work you want to do on your own separate tabs And then you come back 10

4:02:53

20 minutes Boom Shakalaka you've got the deep research ready to go Now if you want to see okay what's going on And

4:02:59

then you can see here it's processing the data in the background Once this is done obviously it's going to take

4:03:04

anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes to get that back to us and then we can download the research report once it's done Also

4:03:11

you can see now if we go back here it's already doing the research It's accessing different papers around the web And this is all whilst I'm recording

4:03:17

a video talking to you All right it's just in the background doing its magic searching the web And again this is

4:03:23

completely free Plus when I set this up this morning between setting up web UI and inserting the API for Google AI

4:03:30

Studio it literally took me like 5 minutes right It's so quick and fast to use these especially once you get a bit

4:03:36

of experience setting this all up Now inside the run agent section as well you can also add some additional information

4:03:43

So like some hints on to help the LLM complete tasks So for example potentially you could give it like some

4:03:48

login details if you feel comfortable with that And then it can go off and start logging into different places and

4:03:54

doing its magic Obviously if you scared about privacy you wouldn't do that And then also you can click here and select

4:04:01

use your own browser right So this is how you can configure the browser settings inside user web UI to just go

4:04:08

off and start using your own browser so that you don't need to log in for then because we're using a vision module aka

4:04:14

because the API from Google Gemini can actually see your screen and interact with it and understand what's going on

4:04:20

Then you can select use vision here which you can't get with many other models There's not many models that use vision as multi to be able to operate

4:04:27

the internet Also here you can change the actions per step So you can say okay I want you to take 10 actions per step

4:04:34

maximum So that for example if you're using something like open AI then you don't get rinsed on the credits and also

4:04:40

if you're using a free API then you can add more actions if you want to go more in depth without it getting stuck You

4:04:46

can also change the temperature and the amount of randomness in the model outputs And you can even load like a

4:04:52

previous config file right So if you've got like a a configuration that you really like every time you set this up

4:04:57

locally let's say I close the terminal and then have to set this up again then I can load the previous config file and

4:05:03

we're good to go Now I did stock the deep research early just because I'm recording the video I don't want to be

4:05:09

waiting 20 or 30 minutes to complete the video before we get back to it But here's what we got back from the deep

4:05:14

research agent So it's actually formatted it really nicely It's created a nice report Bear in mind I only let it

4:05:20

run for 120 seconds and it already did all of this If we go to the word counter it's already come back with 700 words of

4:05:26

research connected to the and that is very useful That's a natural use case I know a lot of people say with agents

4:05:33

they don't have a use case or that sort of thing but actually this does This is research is something particularly if

4:05:38

you're a content creator or a business owner you're going to be doing that every single week or every single month So super powerful to do very useful to

## Building Apps with AI Agents

4:05:45

have it there So what we're testing out now as I've said go to llamacoder.to together.ai and build out a to-do list

4:05:50

app And you can see it's already typing that out using Quinn 2.5 coder It's just

4:05:55

running in the background building out an app for us I can't even code but I'm getting AI agent to do it for us It's

4:06:01

doing this all locally It's not costing us a penny Now if you see it's struggling like that for example what we can say inside the context we can say

4:06:09

wait 15 seconds for the coder to build

4:06:14

out the app plus be patient man don't you can't rush greatness all right then hit run agent like now at this point

4:06:20

you're probably going okay that's great can code for you can build apps for you but it's using chromium which is not

4:06:26

logged in with your current sessions you can't interact with your actual environment maybe some people watching

4:06:31

this are feeling a little bit crazy and want to test something out So what you can actually do is you can set up the

4:06:38

EMV file inside the I've got details on how to do that inside the AI profit

4:06:43

border And if you select use your own browser run your Chrome in debug mode

4:06:48

and set up the EMV file correctly then what you can actually do is just get the

4:06:53

agent to run directly in your Chrome browser which is absolutely wild stuff Let me show you an example of this Right

4:07:00

So if we say now inside run agent go to we'll say go to

4:07:07

astudio.google.com/new chat start chatting leave the AI and we've got the

4:07:12

LM configuration is Google Gem 2 flasher experimental we're going to run the agent inside this current browser

4:07:19

session so that the AI is speaking to the other AI and we just get really meta

4:07:25

here So if we run the Asian likes that's going to open up a new tab Now you can see it's navigated to the correct window

4:07:30

and it's analyzing the screen as Hello AI right And by the way this is really weird now because you got an AI speaking

4:07:37

to an AI and they're just having a cheeky chat back and forth aren't they So start and it's messing around It

4:07:42

seems to be messing around with the temperature It's having a little conversation a little bit of small talk and it's what can you do And so now the

4:07:49

AIS are both going back and forth with each other and can you generate images All right So you can see how the AI can

4:07:55

interact with another AI and then what you've got is an army like a swarm of AI agents all working together to get

4:08:02

whatever workflows you want to get done Right So this is really a previous limitation of AI So you couldn't get it

4:08:09

to generate blobs for you without you being there to supervise it But with this method you could go off you could

4:08:15

create a cup of tea and who knows what they're talking about in the background Now I don't recommend it This is

4:08:20

probably not a safe way to use AI particularly if you've got all your login we details stored inside the

4:08:25

browser but I will take that risk on for you just to show you how crazy this can be And then one day maybe I'll get

4:08:32

sleeves on my t-shirt All right I'm going to stop that browser session for now But you get the idea If we go over

4:08:38

to results now you can see that it's giving us the final results and what happened how it worked etc And that was

4:08:44

just with a super basic prompt If I said go to ariststudio.google.com google.com

4:08:49

and then create the best possible SEO article you can about AI SEO with Gemini

4:08:56

2.0 and we'll say no make sure it's beautifully formatted conversational add

4:09:01

some tonality plus add some emojis/ subheadings So we'll run the agent and

4:09:07

now we can basically automate anything inside our existing browser for this agent to just go off and do stuff For

4:09:14

example if you actually said "Okay go over to Amazon and order something for me." Like I'm pretty sure it could do it

4:09:21

for you if you already logged into Amazon directly on there Or for example let's say you wanted it to watch a

4:09:27

YouTube video and then tell you exactly okay what happened on there what was going on etc then it could probably do

4:09:32

that too At this point because it's logged into your browser because it's completely free it's super fast it can

4:09:39

use AI directly etc you can really do some interesting stuff like and I think

4:09:44

this is the way things are going Give it a few months Google chat GBT etc They're

4:09:50

all going to release their own versions of this So you can see here for example like the AI is saying write an article

4:09:55

about SEO It's going to hit run on that I didn't type that in The AI agent did that directly We've got the blog written

4:10:02

and drafted Like you can see that was super simple and easy to do Right The other thing to note here is if you

4:10:07

switch back to your tab let's test something else out now So I'm going to say go to YouTube and analyze Mabet's

4:10:12

channel Julian Goldie and give me a really indepth analysis of his channel

4:10:19

We'll run the agent So it's going off to YouTube now And here's the other thing right If if we actually go to a new tab

4:10:26

So I'm inside the web UI tab now but you can see it's still running in the background right So it's still

4:10:31

processing information inside that extra tab that you've got And if we switch back to it it says Julian Gold SEO It's

4:10:38

going off It's doing its own thing It's wild stuff You can see it's now browsing YouTube It's seeing what's happening etc

4:10:44

It's analyzing my channel And this is the worst it's ever going to be Let's be honest You can actually manually intervene as well So you can see it's

4:10:50

scrolling through the page It's doing its own magic But you can manually intervene and click off or stop it if you need to But basically you can see

4:10:57

how it's analyzing the page And it can scroll up and down the page It can analyze It can look at the images with

4:11:03

it vision mode It can scroll through see everything that's happening here and understand what's going on So thanks so

4:11:09

much for watching That was basically how to use Google and it's free API was just recently released inside the browser use

4:11:17

web UI and then you can get these agents to control your browser go off and do tasks automate basically any sort of

4:11:23

basic admin tasks that you want You can do research deep research Even just that

4:11:28

feature alone is saving you $200 per month And you can see how it's connected to the internet and how these AI agents

4:11:34

work plus how to set them up using web UI Now if you want all the instructions on how to set up the terminal commands

## GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

4:12:27

mode is absolutely insane and it is free to get access to I'm not paying for this

4:12:32

plan And you can see here we've got access to GitHub copilot chat Now I'm going to show you exactly what you can

4:12:38

build with it how you can use it They've got two different modes They've just updated it to agent mode as well And if

4:12:43

we select between edit mode we actually get free access to GPTO3 mini preview

4:12:49

along with claw 3.5 SE and Gemini 2.0 Flash And they are free and available to

4:12:56

use So I'm going to show you exactly how you can get this set up First thing you want to do is make sure that you download Visual Studio Code Insiders

4:13:03

That is completely free You can download it on their website I'll include the links inside the SP as well today And

4:13:08

then once you've done that you want to make sure that you go down to extensions Once you've installed this and then make

4:13:14

sure that you have GitHub copilot installed like you can see right here Additionally we can also install client

4:13:20

and this can help you build apps tools websites etc If we install the extension client which is also free So we're going

4:13:26

to click trust publisher and install Then we go into the settings down here

4:13:32

We can select visual code LM API And then we can actually get free access to

4:13:37

code inside client 3.3 using 03 mini claw 3.5 sonnet And you are not paying

4:13:44

for these right Pretty crazy stuff So let me show you exactly how you can build apps websites tools with this

4:13:50

process So the first way that we're going to do this is we're going to get a prompt from my custom GPT If you want

4:13:56

free access to this it will be inside the SAP in the video notes from today And I'm going to say for example create

4:14:02

an AI automation consultancy landing page selling me what I do etc This will

4:14:09

be used within Hub Copilot And then we'll just get the prompt from this This

4:14:14

is one of the best ways you can generate prompts for creating websites and everything else because you're leveraging the power of the AI to come

4:14:22

up with the most relevant prompt for you so that you can easily and quickly build this out You could also include

4:14:28

information about you who you are etc And if we go back to co-pilot now inside Visual Studio Code it's important to

4:14:34

note that you do need insiders for this You need Visual Studio Code Insiders for this And then we're going to start using

4:14:40

Asian mode over here We'll plug the prompt in Also here as well just to note

4:14:46

you've got the chat version you've got copilot edits right Two different modes right there Something else to know is

4:14:51

that with the free plan you get 2,000 completions plus 50 chat requests If you're using the paid plan you get a lot

4:14:58

more but for most people they won't even go over those sort of limits Then what we've done is we've taken the code from

4:15:04

Copilot as you can see plug that into the edit mode It's created the HTML over here and we've got that good to go And

4:15:10

now if we switch to agent mode which you can do down here so you can select between edit and agent say now run this

4:15:15

Just make sure when you're doing this if you're creating a new file from scratch you would make sure you save the file

4:15:21

This is how easy it is So for example we've said create a website that looks like eBay using the agentic mode and is

4:15:28

setting up the CSS and HTML structure And if you want to open up a new folder and let's say you just want to store

4:15:34

your files all in one place you can click on open set up a new folder And then if you want to toggle the co-pilot

4:15:40

on and off just click on open chat over here and that'll start generating stuff for you Now you'll see two two different

4:15:47

icons right here So let me zoom in for you so you get more obvious but you've got the chat and you've got the co-pilot

4:15:52

edits So c-pilot edits is where you're going to find the agent and you switch between edit mode and agent mode right

4:15:58

So if we go to agent mode and then we'll say something like okay create a website that looks like eBay It's just going to

4:16:05

start setting that project up for us Now what you can see is it's creating the files for the project at the top And if

4:16:12

you need to switch between the files like all you do is you click on the top left over here where it says explorer

4:16:17

and this is where you can see your project files It can be a little bit confusing but that's basically how you use this And then if you click on accept

4:16:23

all the changes we can click done And then if we click run this it will open

4:16:28

it up in your browser like you can see right here If we say okay create a beautiful SEO landing page I'll plug in

4:16:34

some information about me who I am etc And then it will start going off and coding this The good thing about agent

4:16:39

mode is that you can self iterate right So it can see the errors It can see any problems in the project and then go off

4:16:45

and fix them So you see here how it says apply and edits and it gives us a percentage It can basically like scan

4:16:51

through all your code and be like okay we're going to edit this edit that etc Here's what we need to improve Here's

4:16:56

how we can change the existing code that we've got And also the cool thing about this is because it can make edits itself

4:17:02

It can just go off code the project you can go and do something else and then in the background this is running and coding and editing again I'm not

4:17:09

clicking anything or typing anything but we can build all sorts of apps and that sort of thing and again I have not paid

4:17:14

a single penny for any of this 3.5 Sonic is normally a paid API but it's free with Visual Studio Code within the

4:17:20

limits and it's now coding out the style CSS the other benefit of this say versus something like bold new is that it's

4:17:28

hosted locally so you've got the project folder with all the files and then you can come back to it later now finished

4:17:33

running that project and it's going to offer to run this in the terminal So we open it up and there's our website ready

4:17:40

to go Pretty nice actually to be fair I think it's got links to all our social media accounts Nice and clean Full

4:17:46

landing page ready to go See even inserted some icons and that sort of thing And then you can build out the rest of the pages later So if you wanted

4:17:52

to build out the rest of the website you just be like "Okay now create the about me page." And the agent can just go off

4:17:59

and do that Now whilst that's running in the background we can also run a new window So if you rightclick the icon and

4:18:05

then open up a new window you can open up another project and then code like multiple pages multiple websites etc all

4:18:11

at the same time because this is running on autopilot as an agent in the background So for example if we open up

4:18:17

a new folder and then we go over to edit mode we'll select GPT3 mini Just test it

4:18:24

out See what that's like Obviously that only came out what about less than two weeks ago It's the newest API from open

4:18:30

Normally paid we get it for free inside GitHub co-pilot and that's just going to go off and do its magic Now we've got

4:18:35

the about me page on the other website ready to go So let's click and open this And there we go We have the about me

4:18:41

page built out on the website So we've got the homepage ready to go and then we've also got the about me page built

4:18:46

out as well And it wrote all of this content just by itself The other thing as well like you can attach images to

4:18:51

the project later and insert those in But yeah it's pretty nicely formatted as well Includes some information about us

4:18:58

our achievements information about me etc We're good to go on that We can also take the files from the project and then

4:19:04

just run it through liveweave especially if it's a simple one like HTML uh CSS and JavaScript So if we go back to the

4:19:11

project we've taken the HTML already Now we're going to take the style CSS go back to liveweave.com plug that in down

4:19:17

here and then grab the JavaScript as well for the game And now we have our game built out collect the backlinks

4:19:23

game You can see the score is updating in the background with the website ready to go like you can see And if we go back

4:19:29

to that project down here we can switch to PL 3.5 Sonnet for actually improving

4:19:34

the front end right So for example GPC03 mini it will do a great job for coding the back end But like you can see like

4:19:41

the design is not that nice when you actually land on the page So even though it's functional it doesn't look that

4:19:46

nice So the way that you can improve that is if we go back here and we say okay improve the design of the website

4:19:53

make it more beautiful modern sleek and interesting It's now going to start editing the page like you see So it's

4:19:59

generating the edits going through the page figuring out what to improve and we don't have to do anything right It's

4:20:05

really bridge a gap between someone who can't code but has an idea and just getting that implemented really quickly

4:20:12

within the space of 15 minutes of testing this out and using it It's really quick and easy to figure out okay

4:20:17

here's how you use it here's how it works etc And also you can see it's generating the edits for the style CSS

4:20:23

and index html at the same time and improving the JS So it seems to be able to edit like multiple pages at the same

4:20:29

time which is pretty cool Now we could take that go back to liveweave We'll grab the JavaScript again plug that in

4:20:35

here and already it's looking a lot nicer right So if you saw what we previously had versus now it looks a lot

4:20:40

nicer Even the design of the game looks a lot nicer So claw 3.5 Sonic is probably your best bet for the front end

4:20:47

And for the back end GPT03 mini does the job So if we go back to this page now we've got the game ready to go I think

4:20:52

the goal is collect the green ones avoid the red ones game over if you hit the red ones That's it That's how to build a

4:20:59

game and a website at the same time for free using Copilot and AI in one single prompt Pretty crazy stuff And the way

4:21:06

that we generated this idea right here was again using this prompt forge AI

4:21:11

method which is a custom GPT I built specifically for prompting bolt new

4:21:17

copilot client etc to get really good outputs If you want access to that it's inside the AI profit boardroom along

4:21:23

with our crash course on how to make money and save time with AI And if you go to the SAP section over here you will

4:21:29

find the link to the GPT Now if you want to get access for free directly to World

4:21:35

3.5 Sonet and to code big projects out with that what you can actually do is if

4:21:40

you go to client so make sure you've got client 3.3 installed inside the extensions marketplace So you go to

4:21:46

extensions client install that Once you've done that go down to client here and then inside your settings to click

4:21:52

the cog in the top right Select VS Code LM API and then in this list you're going to find for example Copilot GBC 4

4:22:00

Mini 40 03 Mini Crawl 3.5 Sonet and Gemini 2.0 Flash Now you can also insert

4:22:06

instructions here So you can insert custom instructions on how to use it Let me show you some examples of what I've used previously So inside here inside

4:22:13

the custom instructions I've said you're a coder for Goldie agency information about us Here's what we do Here's the links to our funnels Here's what to use

4:22:20

etc You can also include like your brand colors and also information about your social media links each project can

4:22:26

actually include inside the design So let's test for example inside client 3.3

4:22:32

we said build out a to-do list We're using Visual Studio Code and Claw 3.5

4:22:37

Sonet We'll allow that We'll close copilot for now And you can see it's based on this task to build a to-do list

4:22:43

app and the current environment And it's using the custom instructions that we gave it before Now it's building out the

4:22:48

file as you can see So it's creating the index.html And the good thing about client as well is that you can set it on

4:22:54

auto approve So you don't need to keep clicking approve or anything like that It's just going to approve and build everything out for you And then you've

4:23:01

got the files stored locally So for example it switched from building out the index html to the style CSS And then

4:23:08

eventually it will add a JavaScript for the functionality of the actual app Now

4:23:14

it's ready to go So if we hit run command that's going to open up the project Now we've got the project ready

4:23:19

to go So it's created the whole landing page etc and it's given us some example tasks already Let's test if this works

4:23:25

So we'll say test client 3.3 Add the task And you can see it's added perfectly Plus we've got a link to our

4:23:32

free SEO strategy session on the page And I think one of the best ways to use this is like you find recommended tools

4:23:37

games apps etc that people are searching for inside your niche And then you can

4:23:43

easily create these mini landing pages or mini websites host them rank them Quite easy to do So as an example of

4:23:49

this it's a great lead generation method So if we put for example SEO game you can see here people searching out on

4:23:55

Google as an SEO agency we could easily create this build it out with C-pilot or

4:24:01

client 3.3 get it hosted and boom we've got a new lead generation method Same

4:24:06

for example if we put calculator there's so many terms you can rank for around that And obviously whatever industry

4:24:12

you're in you would change this right So if you're in the finance niche you can put finance calculator Or if you're in

4:24:18

the health niche you can put health calculator or health game That's actually pretty easy to rank for decent

4:24:23

traffic potential And there's a bunch of other keyword ideas down here It's so easy to build out these apps tools

4:24:28

websites games etc using a combination of clan 3.3 or GitHub copilot And by the

4:24:34

way if you're wondering okay like how do you get this hosted For example if we open this up if we reveal that in Finder

4:24:39

we've got the project files right here Now if we go to Netifi and this is a service someone could sell easily as

4:24:45

building out landing pages or apps or tools for a client you can just go to

4:24:50

add a new site import from an existing project Netleifi drop grab that folder from before drag it in there and then

4:24:58

you can just easily deploy your files like you can see and that literally took a minute or two If we open that up we've now got this hosted on a subdomain We

4:25:05

can share this with people For example if we open this up in a new incognito tab we've now got a subdomain hosted with our to-do list or our game or our

4:25:12

tool and we built it all out for free Even hosting it on the subdomain on netifi is completely free And just to be

4:25:19

clear here you're not paying for client you're not paying for cohob pilot or I haven't paid for it and you've seen how

4:25:24

much I've used it today You're not paying for visual studio code insider You're not paying to host it on a subdomain Like all of this is free It's

4:25:31

pretty wild stuff Plus you've got it hosted locally so you can come back to the project whenever you want And if

4:25:37

you've never coded before you could get this to work within a day You can figure this stuff out So thanks so much for

4:25:43

watching What I'm actually going to do is I'm going to plug in all the SAPs all the links and all the prompts from today directly inside the AI profit boardroom

4:25:49

If you go inside the classroom you get a ton of courses here but we're actually going to plug this inside the SAP section along with all my latest video

4:25:56

SAPs If we add a new page here called hub core p- pilot agent mode you can find a link to our custom GPT for

4:26:03

programming these pretty easily If you want the custom instructions for client I've added that inside here as well So

4:26:09

you can just personalize those and copy and paste them in If you want the example prompt from the game I've also plugged that in along with a link to an

4:26:16

example site that we built just now as you can see And if you want the step-by-step instructions on exactly how

4:26:21

you or your team or your virtual assistant can set all of this up for you you could sell this as a service You

4:26:27

could do it for yourself you could scale lots of tools out internally to save your team time Then I plugged in the SAP

4:26:33

directly into the video notes from today That's inside the AI profit boardroom Link in the comments description And if

4:27:09

comments description Appreciate you watching Deep sea computer use agents are absolutely insane and they're completely free So what you can actually

## Setting Up DeepSeek and Alarma

4:27:15

do is you can install browser use web UI and this is running locally on our terminal like you can see right here and

4:27:23

basically this is a free AI agent that you can install using deepseek to basically run your browser and run

4:27:29

commands So for example if we go into LM configuration over here you will see that we have Alama And then inside alarm

4:27:35

they've just got a new update where you can actually have alarm with Deepseek

4:27:40

R114B or Deepseek R132B running in the background And then

4:27:46

from here you can just run the agent and just ask it to go off and do whatever you want So as an example of this we can

4:27:52

even use our own browser And if you're wondering okay how do you set up Deep Seek Alama This is pretty simple to do

4:27:59

All you're going to do is you're going to download O Lama This is completely free and it's like a one-click install

4:28:04

Then once you've done that you're going to go to Deep Seek One Then you're going to select B from the drop-own list Copy

4:28:10

that code Go over to terminal start a new window All right So right click the icon start a new window Plug that in

4:28:17

Make sure you have Alarma 2 running So it will show up with the icon right there Plug that in And now you have

4:28:23

DeepSeek R114B running along with browser use web UI ready to go Now that

4:28:29

is a pretty powerful model If you're struggling to run that locally then you can always press control and D That will

4:28:35

close the terminal like you can see So you can stop it running And then what you can do instead if you prefer is you

4:28:41

can actually go over to AI Studio in Google Grab a new API key from Google

4:28:46

which is completely free as well And then go over to LM configuration You're

4:28:51

going to select Google from the list and you can plug in your API key down here All right But whether you're using

4:28:56

DeepSeek you can also use Deepseek and the API right here But obviously you have to understand that's going to cost

4:29:03

money Whereas if you're running Olama locally with Deepseek and also supports

4:29:08

Quen and Llama 2 and Deep Seek R1 then that's completely free So this is a a free way to get access to the browser

4:29:15

agent Now here's the other thing right Chat GPT operator which is the open AI

4:29:21

release from browser agents This which is open AAI's equivalent basically to browser use web UI is only available to

4:29:28

pro users and it costs $200 per month But by watching this and understanding how you can use browser use web UI

4:29:35

instead with alarm then you're saving yourself $200 per month And not only

4:29:40

that Chatch GBT and OpenAI also released deep research agents But even if you're

4:29:46

paying $200 per month you're limited to three searches per day So if you want to use this feature it's going to cost you

4:29:52

$200 per month and then you can only have three searches per day You are limited to 100 per month Instead what

4:29:59

you can do is you can go over to browser use web UI and once you've configured your API you can then go over to deep

4:30:05

research and you can ask it to research whatever you want And that's basically going to use the internet to do a lot of

4:30:11

research on whatever you're trying to find information about And it will even give you a research report But either

4:30:17

way number one you get to select the API you can run Number two it's completely local so it's more private Number three

4:30:23

you can run the agent in your browser and get it to do tasks And number four you can use deep research and download

4:30:29

the research reports So let me show you exactly how this works step by step So if you just want to use the agent and

4:30:34

let's say for example you just want to go to google.com and check the

4:30:40

SNP 500 shares today All right we can run the agent You can see it's

4:30:46

processing over here So we've got the information processing and now you can see inside our own browser Look I'm not

4:30:52

typing anything out You can get DeepS or you can get whatever API you want to use the internet And this is all whilst it's

4:30:59

logged in to your existing account You shouldn't do this You shouldn't have it

4:31:04

But I want to take that risk for you And you can see here now it's interacting directly inside my Chrome It's not like

4:31:10

in a virtual environment which you can run by default I'll show you how to set that up in a second But this is actually

4:31:17

inside my main Chrome Crazy stuff All right And then if you go to results

4:31:23

you'll see the information from the prompt that you just ran Additionally you can also go to recordings and you

4:31:28

can watch back your recordings By the way if you want to know exactly how to set this up step by step I've got it inside the AI property boardroom link in

4:31:35

the comments description If you go to the SAP section then scroll down to the computer use agent section you can get

4:31:41

all the instructions and the terminal commands I use to not just set it up also to set it up inside Chrome because

4:31:46

you have to give it a special command for doing that And if you don't want to use your own browser because obviously

4:31:52

it is a little bit dangerous is you are letting an AI control your whole browser

4:31:58

then you would deselect that So let me show you an example So if we go back to run agent now and we'll say okay go to

4:32:05

Twitter and create an interesting

4:32:10

tweet about SEO then post it Let's see if it can actually do that I imagine

4:32:16

that it's probably going to get stuck before it can post but it might just draft it So let's see what happens next

4:32:22

It's going over to Twitter so it's navigating there It's figuring out what's popping what's going on So you

4:32:27

can see how it's selecting the whole screen and using it mode to really understand what's happening on screen

4:32:32

Now it's actually writing This is crazy This is crazy stuff And now it is

4:32:39

analyzing the page Is he going to post it Now you can see if we go back to the

4:32:47

model fors it didn't post it I think it's going to have limits on what it can do depending on which API you use I'm

4:32:52

pretty sure if you use something like DeepSeek it's probably just going to post it straight out But you can see here you've got the model thoughts So

4:32:59

it's told you exactly what it's doing how it's doing it what it wrote etc It was incredibly fast at typing Actually

4:33:04

that was unbelievable Now if you want to stop at any time you can just click stop and that will stop the AI agent Let's

4:33:10

test something else out now So I'm going to say go to Amazon and find me the link building mastery book by Julian Goldie

4:33:17

Let's see if it does it So we'll run the agent now You can see it's running there So you're going to see if you're not you're going to know if it's working or

4:33:23

not just by the bottom And also this can just work in the background right So whilst you're running this you can just

4:33:30

carry on doing whatever you want to do So it's going to run in a new tab separate tab like you can see and it's

4:33:36

going to figure out okay here's what we're doing Here's how we're doing it Right You can see it's searching for the book It's analyzing which book to click

4:33:42

And then you can see in the final results So go to the results tab It says the book link building mastery How to

4:33:49

rank higher Grow your SEO traffic and build authority with backlinks by Julian Goldie is found Right So it read the

4:33:54

whole title from the book Found it Boom Ready to go So it actually has a use case now because it can go off It can

4:34:02

draft messages for you on Twitter It could probably go on to WordPress for you if you wanted to and start drafting

4:34:07

a post And it can also do deep research So for example if we say okay research

4:34:12

how AI is impacting the SEO industry and websites in general We're going to run

4:34:19

the deep research report like so You can now see it's running and it's just going to open up a new tab and start doing the

4:34:27

research for us So honestly I think it's getting to the point now where it can do a lot for you right It can open multiple

4:34:33

tabs It can control your browser with all your login in there It can write tweets for you and draft them so you

4:34:39

just have to hit post It can search for stuff on Amazon It can build like full research reports like you can see And it

4:34:46

can do this all in the background whilst you do something else As you can see this is still researching still still

4:34:53

looking things up in the background whilst we get other stuff done Now another AI browser I want to show you

4:34:59

this quickly because a lot of people are actually saying this is better than the chat cheapity operator as well which is

4:35:04

convergence dot And basically you can get AI to complete your tasks here Now this is basically like a fully automated

4:35:11

AI assistant So for example let's say we want to summarize the top news stories

4:35:16

today We can just go to daily news for me and it already has these workflows built out So for example like you will

4:35:22

produce a daily update for the topics of technology and economics Now you can see it's searching the web So it's actually

4:35:27

gone on to Guardian Says navigate to the technology section Visit Guardian Pick a new story Click on the story and read it

4:35:34

fully And this is basically like another virtual environment So it's a bit safer than running browsery web UI inside your

4:35:41

own Chrome login Much safer to have it in a virtual environment The only thing that I would say with this is it seems

4:35:46

to be a lot slower than using some of the other APIs we were looking at before So whether that's because of so much

4:35:53

demand or something like that you can see here it's still stuck on stage one You can see here is gradually working

4:35:58

through it But I think if you gave browser use web UI the same prompt it would get better results Let's test this

4:36:05

out Actually we're going to say the same thing now So these are the results from convergence And this is browser use web

4:36:12

UI actually just doing the same thing but live inside our browser Now convergence has come back to us and it's

4:36:17

given us like a technology news summary as you can see as well as a business news summary So that is quite useful I

4:36:24

think you could use chat GPT40 for the same thing I don't think you actually need a browser for that And you can see

4:36:29

the browser use web UI is just doing its magic But it's already been 2 minutes We're going to stop it there and see how

4:36:34

it went Yeah I would say convergence AI actually got a better report I think because of all the pop-ups convergence

4:36:40

AI actually did a better result than the computer use agent inside browser use web UI When you're doing this as well

4:36:47

just a little tip here is like if you're going to run the deep research report don't run it in the same browser Use a

4:36:53

separate browser cuz it's going to open up many tabs seems to be quite buggy if you use it in your own browser So for

4:36:58

running the agent that's great for using it in Chrome And by the way all the SAP all the instructions all the commands

4:37:04

that I use to set up are inside the AI profit boardroom But if you're going to do deep research reports just make sure

4:37:10

you don't have that selected So if we go back to browser use web UI now and we

4:37:15

check out the deep research report on AI and SEO we can check the report We'll see how long this was So this is a

4:37:23

588word article on how SEO is changing the AI landscape and you can see and

4:37:29

it's actually it's nicely formatted It's nicely written etc Talks about how to future proof your strategy It's not bad

4:37:36

at all It's nowhere near as long as deep research reports from chat GBT But I think 99% of people are not going to

4:37:42

read a 10,000word report Like have you ever seen the reports from Chat GBT Unless you are trying to create a

4:37:49

dissertation you probably don't need that much research or you're going to ask Chachi Bet to reduce it anyway and

4:37:55

condense it anyway So thanks so much for watching That is exactly how to set this up The other thing I was going to say is

4:38:00

you do get agent settings So you can choose between for example how many run steps and the maximum number of run

4:38:06

steps in each action the maximum number of actions per step and whether you want to use vision or not when you're running

4:38:12

the agent Additionally this seems to be getting updated all the time So I can imagine it's only going to get better

4:38:17

It's already better than most browser agents I've seen out there So pretty powerful stuff So thanks so much for watching If you want to get access to

4:38:23

the SAP and how to set this up for yourself feel free to get that It's inside the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description Just go to the

4:38:30

## Perplexity's Deep Research Capabilities

4:39:25

deep research Now this is like an alternative to open AI's deep research except here's the biggest difference

4:39:32

Normally you would pay $200 for deep research capabilities inside Chat GPT

4:39:38

Pro but now you get access to it for free inside Plexi So you get up to five queries per day for nonsubscribers and

4:39:45

500 queries per day for pro users Bear in mind Chat GPT's deep research limit

4:39:51

is 100 per month for operator Whereas if you're on the free plan on Plexi you get

4:39:57

five queries per day You can see it in action right here Here's an example of the benchmarks So if we pull this up

4:40:03

this is a comparison for QA of Plexi Deep Research versus OpenAI And you can

4:40:09

see a huge difference right there which is pretty wild We've got the deep research stats on Plexi scores So it

4:40:14

scored 21.1% on humanity's last exam outperforming Gemini Thinking 03 Mini 01

4:40:20

Decar 1 and other top models We'll be testing out today I'll show you exactly how to get access and how to use this step by step But I'm super excited The

## Getting Started with Deep Research

4:40:27

Blexi always come up with a good So let's get straight into it So if you want to get started with this just open up a new thread and then you're going to

4:40:34

select deep research from the dropdown So this is what you can use And if we say for example okay tell me about how

4:40:40

AI will impact SEO in 2025 We'll plug that in And you can see it's now

4:40:46

beginning to do the deep research Now it says deep research often takes a few minutes to complete I'll start by

4:40:52

preparing a research plan Now bear in mind if you're using chat GBT and the

4:40:57

deep research function in there it's usually going to take about 10 to 30 minutes per research report So we'll put

## Comparing ChatGPT and Perplexity

4:41:04

exactly the same prompt into chat GBT versus compare the deep research

4:41:10

functionalities here But here what chat GBT often does it will come back to you and say can you clarify a few aspects

4:41:16

I'm just going to say give me all of them and it will go off and start doing the research But here you can see that

4:41:21

it's actually going to take quite a long time to get that back If we come on to Plexi it seems to be a lot faster when

4:41:26

we're getting the results Now if we click on starting research there's no feedback from chatb But if we go back to

4:41:33

Publix it's already telling us okay we've looked at 25 sources Here's what we're going to do step by step It's like

4:41:40

think it out as a reasoning model It's giving us all the sources And then once it's ready it's going to tell us exactly

4:41:45

what we need to do So if we have a look at these steps is first of all I need to search the web for information on how AI

4:41:51

is expected to impact SEO trends 2025 right from the most recent research I found a wealth of information suggesting

4:41:57

that AI is significantly transforming SEO blah blah blah and it's just going off and do the magic now the answer has

4:42:03

already come back to us and we've got a pretty detailed report here now it's still reeling off but that is pretty

4:42:09

powerful stuff now for sure this has been triggered by the release from chat GPT on deep research but You can see you

4:42:16

get very similar outputs except that Plexi seems to be a lot faster So chat GPT is not even I would say it's

4:42:24

probably about 20% of the way through this So it's going to take quite a while to get that back whereas Plexi has already come back to us with the goods

## Exploring Perplexity's Features

4:42:30

You can also inside here ask to search images videos and generate an image as well And it also gives you follow-up

4:42:37

questions right here Top of that you can share this with people So you can share with your team If we open this up on a new incognito we'll check what got back

4:42:43

here So if we open this up we can X off that and we can actually share it with people like they don't need to log in or anything like that And then we've got

4:42:49

the sources So you can see these numbers here These are sources of the research that was used So it's using for example

4:42:54

like Brian Dean's exploding topics article on the future of SEO and this was published in 2025 So it's not using

4:43:01

like really old data from what I can see Let's have a look at this one Yeah again this is a pretty recent blog that we can

4:43:06

see from seooma.com and it summarized the key findings and then the evolution

4:43:12

of everything So it seems to be a lot faster And again you can do this for free You get five free queries per day

4:43:19

for nonsubscribers So you don't need to sign up to the premium plan You don't need to pay for this And this is like a very

4:43:25

valid alternative to using Chat GPT steam research which costs $200 per

4:43:30

month Now that's halfway through I would say at this point it's already used 22 sources on Chat GPT But again like if

4:43:36

you want speedy fast results you don't want to wait 30 minutes and open up chat GPT and then close it and then wait ages

4:43:41

then this is probably the best alternative Now what I want to test as well is whe multiple different research

## Testing Multiple Research Reports

4:43:49

reports in different tabs So I'm going to say for example research similar alternatives to profit boardroom

4:43:56

community and we'll plug that in So let's see if we can upload images directly inside here Yes so you can

4:44:01

upload images which is pretty useful Let's have a look if you can do that inside chat GPT deep research options So

4:44:06

if we select deep research yeah you can upload images inside chat GPT deep research too and then I want to say

4:44:12

based on my community for the AI profit boardroom give me a breakdown of the

4:44:18

market and my competitors plus what I need to think about in this industry to

4:44:24

improve my offer By the way if you want to join the AI profit boardroom link in the comments description So we've given

4:44:30

that to Perplexi to figure out now and it's researching the profit boardrooms market and competitors So that's pretty

4:44:36

cool And then if we go inside here we're going to say okay do a research report on automation agencies Here's some info

4:44:43

about my agency services for AI automation right And then for this one

4:44:49

we're just going to get some information from our website We'll copy that We'll plug it into Plexity and see what we get

4:44:55

back Now the thing I like as well is it doesn't ask us for more information just goes off and does it Whereas for example

4:45:00

cheap makes it a little bit more complex cuz it gives you loads of questions right before you can even get the answer And so like I think some people would

4:45:06

just be like I can't be bothered answering all these questions I'm just going to go off and get the report honestly And then you've got the report

4:45:13

already back from Perplexity on the community ideas And then also it's doing

4:45:18

the research on the AI automation So you can open multiple tabs and then do multiple research reports at the same

4:45:25

time which is great because then you don't have to wait for one report then do another and otherwise you're going to

4:45:30

be wasting a lot of time So let's have a look at some of the key ideas and stats from this report and just really analyze

## Analyzing Research Reports

4:45:36

it in detail So it's got key findings AI overviews dominate the SERs Content quality over quantity that makes sense

4:45:42

Fragmented search behavior These are pretty valid key findings I would say this is the way AI is going If you seen

4:45:48

my interview with Neil Patel then you have seen this insight on fragmented search behavior and how we were talking

4:45:53

about how in 2025 it's really like a search everywhere not just search Google SEO strategy that you want to be

4:45:59

implementing And then also this is a pretty good stat as well automation efficiency 86% of SEO professionals

4:46:05

leverage AI tools to save 12.5 hours weekly on tasks like keyword researchers

4:46:10

site audits Pretty useful stuff right there Then it's talked about the rise of AI first search engines for example like

4:46:17

search GPT and Google search genative experience Everything in here feels

4:46:22

better than what you would get normally from a research report Everything in here is quite to the point as well These

4:46:28

are very valid insights but it's not too wordy and it's not too long If we take that whole report let's see what we got

4:46:34

here So we'll take that open up and it is in total 1,200 words So it's not too

4:46:40

long Chat GPT is still coming back to us Meanwhile Publexi has already done two different research reports So it's done

4:46:47

three research reports essentially in the time that Chat GPT is still doing one And we'll compare the insights from

4:46:52

chat Let's have a look on the next one So it's given us a market overview and the global AI market is experiencing

4:46:58

rapid growth with an expected annual growth rate of set 36% Good time to be in the market by the way Some ideas on

4:47:05

different communities that we're competing with I've never actually heard of any of these to be fair Let's see where they're getting that from These

4:47:10

are more like AI tools I wouldn't say they're direct competitors So I don't know how it's got that insight to be

4:47:16

honest So indirect competitors AI business tools and consulting services Direct competitors These are not direct

4:47:22

competitors to be fair Like for example Board Mix that seems to be more like an AI tool not a community So it's not

4:47:27

really a competitor Not very useful honestly I I would definitely say like the SEO report is much more useful than

4:47:34

the AI community report that's come back to us Then it's given us key considerations for improving your offer

4:47:40

And we've already incorporated a lot of this stuff on the page So that's not very useful either And then it's given

4:47:46

us some actionable reports And it said conduct a detailed competitor analysis using tools like board mix Invest in

4:47:52

developing or integrating code and edge AI features Regularly engage members Thank you Captain Obvious If you have a

4:47:59

community of course you're going to do that Monitor industry trends So here's what I'm thinking right And my opinion

4:48:05

has changed dramatically from this report versus the first one on like industry insights Super useful Like this

4:48:12

stuff this is great right The second report that we got back for the

4:48:18

community and how to improve the offer All this stuff is super obvious and not very relevant right So I would say it's

4:48:23

very generic I would rate this report probably about a 2 out of 10 This report is probably coming in at a 7 out of 10

4:48:29

and probably better than most humans can do Let's check the last one So now we've asked for details on like research

4:48:35

report on AI automation agencies based on what we're doing So let's see what has come back here We'll check the word

4:48:41

count first of all 1,000 words Honestly like the word count is not that different from your typical perplexity

4:48:47

report The whole headline feels like very AI if that makes sense Like the transformative row of AI automation

4:48:53

agencies Pretty generic and feels like AI fluff This is all fluff This is

4:48:58

pretty useful stuff to know So it's given us some ideas on what we could sell pricing models That's super useful

4:49:04

to be fair It's given us some ideas on what we can charge how much people are charging for like SAS tools in the same

4:49:10

space retainers and also challenges and ethical considerations So I'm rating

4:49:15

this one I would say this is probably about a 6 out of 10 maybe a 7 out of 10 The conclusion isn't bad Yeah I'm giving

4:49:21

that a 6 out of 10 Let's have a look what Chat GPT came back to us with Wow we're still waiting for that Could be

4:49:26

waiting all day for that This could be a long video just waiting around for chat GPT to generate the research reports

4:49:31

Let's see what else we can do here So you can add it to a space You can also convert it to a page So when you convert

4:49:36

this to a page what that means is it's indexable and sharable to pretty much everyone on Publexi So for example if we

4:49:43

type in on Google Publexi/ page which is all where all the Plexi pages are stored you can see

4:49:50

there's 10 different pages of content right And this stuff actually ranks on Google So if we go on to Google now if

4:49:56

we actually check out Perplexity's rankings and how much traffic they get from their pages section you can see

4:50:01

they're getting like 122K traffic just from the pages category including subfolders which is pretty impressive to

4:50:08

be fair And also this stuff indexes on Google If we look over the last week you can see stuff is indexing and ranking on

4:50:15

Google within the last few days So that's pretty useful as well It's a nice little feature And also you can design

4:50:21

this page once you've published it as a page and then insert sections add media

4:50:26

edit different bits insert more content at the bottom etc and add a cover as

4:50:31

well You can actually generate the cover using AI So if we click on generate image and then photograph it will

4:50:37

actually generate like a cover image for our perexi page based on the original report that we created Let's see what

4:50:43

other sources it's used here So it's using some pretty irrelevant stuff as well from the list that I can see Not bad to be fair like the reports are not

4:50:49

bad by the way That is a terrible image on the Publexi page that's published So I think it's a great free alternative

4:50:56

Very quick That's what I like about it It definitely is a competitor chat to chat GBT deep research I like the way

4:51:02

that it cuts out the fluff as well And also the stats and the insights pretty useful in the majority of cases All

4:51:09

right so came back 20 minutes later and the chatbt deep research report is still

4:51:15

thinking It's been stuck on like the last bit of progress right there for about 5 or 10 minutes Doesn't seem to

4:51:21

have come back to us So from what I can see Publexi is definitely a better option It's cheaper It's free It works

4:51:28

quickly You actually get results The resources I would say they're better than your average researcher but they're

4:51:34

probably not going to be like your specialist researcher if that makes sense So someone who like if you were if

4:51:39

you're comparing this versus a PhD researcher I think you're going to get better results back from a human but

4:51:45

it's still pretty powerful and super useful Plus he can ask follow-ups and go deeper into the topics you want after

4:51:51

you've done the first set of deep research And you can keep that selected on deep research down there Now if you

4:51:56

want to see a previous report that actually worked on chat for deep research you can see this example This was actually done in just 9 minutes

4:52:03

using 19 resources Now if we actually look the research you get back from chat GBT it's much more in depth than Publexi

4:52:12

right There's a much higher word count here If we actually count the word count let me have a look in a second see what

4:52:17

we got here So that is in total 10,600 words So it's a lot more in depth

4:52:23

but there's a lot more fluff in there as well If you want to just get straight to the facts he's going to do that job for you like you can see right here But if

4:52:30

you need a dissitation level research report then this is probably more in depth that a human can actually do

4:52:36

However what you can see here is that quite often it will re it will source places that are not that reliable right

4:52:43

So for example if you were trying to create an expert research report you're probably not going to check on forums on

4:52:48

Reddit where anyone can post But inside Chat GBT actually does do that quite often And additionally it's just got a

4:52:55

lot of fluff in there to actually read this report It's going to take you about an hour or so to get through 10,000

4:53:00

words So thanks so much for watching Plexi Deep Research is a great option

4:53:06

like you can see completely free You can get access to it now And if you want to get access to the AI profit boardroom

4:53:12

which comes with hot seat calls my best AI SEO tons of training on AI agents

4:53:19

4:53:26

4:53:39

hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales on autopilot on this free link building acceleration session You'll get a free SEO domination plan or the secret

4:53:46

SEO link building We answer any questions you have onetoone So today we're going to be testing out data button which is like an AI agent that

## Creating Full Stack Apps with Data Button

4:53:54

can essentially do a full stack code for you So this is way beyond for example

4:53:59

oneclick no code tools like bolt or anything like that because you can actually build the full stack and you

4:54:05

can deploy to a domain It's very easy to do that You can even for example integrate stripe processing and you can

4:54:11

do it without coding because you can just go back and forth in the chat and connect Firebase as well So let's crack

4:54:17

straight into this So we're going to click click get started So you can also connect it to your GitHub account which is super useful for pushing this live

4:54:24

And then once you've logged in you can basically build whatever software you want So inside the description here you

4:54:30

can just explain what it is what you're trying to build how it works etc So here's an example We're going to say build an SEO jobboard app add a login

4:54:37

page full stack application for SEO agencies trying to SEOs allow them to upload jobs etc And then we're going to

4:54:44

click continue Now from here what you can actually do is upload specifications requirements user stories prompts quotes

4:54:51

etc And then I'm going to use a custom GPT to prompt this This is inside the AI profit boardroom I'm going to say for

4:54:57

prompting data button full stack AI creator Give the prompt build an SEO jobboard app Add a login page full stack

4:55:04

application for SEO agencies trying to hire SEOs Allow them to upload jobs etc And then include information on

4:55:10

requirements user story specification and quote Now this just allows me to plan out the whole project using AI and

4:55:16

this custom GPT it's built for example like prompting G apps like ROD client

4:55:22

GitHub copilot and also bolt so you can see here for example it's coming up with

4:55:27

the specifications so we'll be using Firebase for authentication then added

4:55:33

some quotes etc and we'll copy that prompt and then plug it straight into data button so let's download that then

4:55:39

we'll drag and drop it in here so that's uploading the require requirements Then once that's uploading we can click on

4:55:45

continue It says here how many websites or images we can use for inspiration Let's take a screenshot of for

4:55:51

inspiration Like you can see obviously you need to be careful with copyright and stuff like that I'm not planning to

4:55:58

launch a job app This is just for a demo on a website but you can see how we're building it out step by step Then for

4:56:04

creating accounts you can actually link fire which will allow people to log in with for example with their Google

4:56:09

accounts for example And also we can set up stripes So stripe will allow for payment processing You can also link

4:56:16

this to superbase as well So there's some awesome stuff you can do with this For authentication let's go with

4:56:22

Firebase And now it is creating the app step by step What I love about this is just how easy it is and you can build

4:56:28

MVP So you can see here the AI agent is saying I'm taking the information you've provided and turning it into a plan so

4:56:33

we can follow to build an MVP users will love All right So we filled in the description the requirements the

## Building and Deploying the App

4:56:39

inspiration the integrations Now this goes far beyond something you could build with bolt New or these other apps

4:56:45

like this is creating something that's far bigger right If you just want to create a simple landing page simple game

4:56:51

a simple tool bolt.noo is great for that But if you want to build something pretty epic like this like you can see

4:56:57

we're it's even given us the idea for the SEO agency job board name which is SEO ConnectHub And you can see step by

4:57:04

step it plans out exactly how to build this Plus you've got a chat if you want to ask any questions And you can see

4:57:09

here is "Hello it's wonderful to chat with you I'm excited to help you bring your SEO job board vision to life I've

4:57:15

created a detailed implementation plan that will take us from concept to a fully functional MVP." And the whole

4:57:22

process is just so easy All you need is the idea And let's be honest like you could ask chat GPT specific for 20

4:57:29

different ideas in your niche And then you can launch all these apps share them for free use it for lead generation or whatever you want You can also see

4:57:35

there's a deploy option over here Now if we want to add Firebase we can do it like so It gives us the instructions and

4:57:41

it's pretty easy to set up And now we can start going off and completing each task step by step So if we click on

4:57:47

start task this is now going to start working its magic Like you can see it's just going off and it's right now I'm

4:57:53

going to create the landing page So it's got the observations the plan and the next steps on what to do Bear in mind

4:57:58

like I have zero coding experience never learned code but now I can build a full

4:58:04

stack app using this process So you can see some of the other steps as well So for example like building job posting

4:58:09

management for agencies implementing the job search and listing page developing the agency dashboard the jobseker

4:58:16

dashboard and creating a basic admin panel for content moderation Now we've got an update It said implemented

4:58:22

professional landing page with clean navigation bar hero section features grid and strong If you want to check this out you can just click on here So

4:58:29

you're just going to add a custom username that you can use on the app Then you can click on deploy app and

4:58:35

it's got the subdomain ready to go So we've got the app deploying in the top right like you can see right here So

4:58:40

it's got like a loading status Now once it's deploying it might take a few minutes to deploy that What you're going to see is a a loading section like this

4:58:47

And now we have the subdomain deployed And boom Look at that That is very much inspired by.com So it's got SEO connect

4:58:56

You can sign in You've got a signin page You can post a job browse the jobs and create an account And it's looking

4:59:01

pretty good so far That's just stage one So we can mark that as done now And now we can move on to setting up the

4:59:07

Firebase implementation So this is how people can log in get their usernames etc So if we click on start task we're

4:59:13

going to go over to Firebase go to our project then we need to go to project settings So if you go to overview and

4:59:19

then project settings it would be better if it told you exactly where to go This is pretty general to be honest with you

4:59:25

if you're trying to figure this out for the first time If you're not sure what to do here what we can actually do is just take like a screenshot of that And

4:59:30

then I'm going to go over to Claude paste in the image from data button and say how to set this up So now we need to

4:59:37

click the code icon Here we go Give the app a nickname So we'll put data button here Register the app Then we need to

4:59:43

take the code from here Go over to data button Plug that in And now all these

4:59:48

links are linked right So if we go back here we're going to click on or get started Authorize domains inside the settings section So go to settings

4:59:55

authorize domains Then we're going to copy this We'll add that domain And we'll add that one Here we go You can

5:00:00

also enable fire store database which will allow you to collect user data and

5:00:06

then we'll install this So it's creating a login page for the app Now that was fairly simple and easy to do And by the

5:00:12

way if you want the SP for all this stuff that we're doing step by step feel free to get it inside the AI profit

5:00:17

boardroom including all my best agents and everything else So if you're getting stuck or if you need weekly coaching or

5:00:23

you want to jump on a call with me you can join the AI profit boardroom and we do weekly coaching calls Plus you can

5:00:30

watch back and ask any questions you have inside the community So it's setting that up now And this was easier

5:00:37

than I expected I thought something would go wrong there Usually if you're using something like Bolt you get loads

5:00:42

of errors You have to go back and forth a lot But this seems to be much much easier which is great All right so we've

5:00:47

set that up now This should be looking pretty good If we go on to our domain we've completed step number two which is

5:00:54

beautiful And now we're just going to keep running through each section step by step So we've completed stage two Can

5:01:00

mark that as done Let's get started with this The rest of it should be pretty easy It's really only the Firebase bit

5:01:06

that's a bit tricky because you have to integrate connecting the domains and authorizing it And that just takes a

5:01:13

couple of minutes to get your head around the first time you're trying it But apart from that this is pretty simple stuff I'm no genius So this

5:01:19

should be good to go Now I've got the job management dashboard the implementation of the management system

5:01:24

the edit job page We can test that it works as well If you have any errors along the way what you can also do is

5:01:30

say for example whatever your problem is you can say okay when I try to test this and it doesn't work here's the error

5:01:36

right And then data button will actually fix any errors and troubleshoot them for you as well Bear in mind as well when

5:01:42

you deploy you want to deploy the current version of it each time you want to test a change So for example this was last deployed 19 minutes ago So we want

5:01:49

to deploy the new version now And once that's done you'll get a successfully deployed app notification Let's refresh

5:01:55

the page See what we got here And if we click on post a job which wasn't working before the deployment Now we can sign in

5:02:01

with Google and test out And now we've logged in with the Gmail account And that was beautiful So now if we put in

5:02:07

the details of the job Okay SEO agency VA We'll put in here job description for

5:02:12

an SEO agency VA on Chat GBT just so we can plug this in with some demo data One

5:02:17

thing to bear in mind here when you're setting this up you want to make sure that you have if you're testing this on the test domain make sure that you have

5:02:23

the test domain set up as well Right So we've got for example Julian Goldie.databutton.app allowed on the

5:02:30

domains list Otherwise you won't be able to sign in with Google We're going to just put in this dummy data right here as an example Location Zimbabwe of

5:02:37

course 100 We're feeling a little bit stingy Maximum salary want 10 million

5:02:42

because sometimes you never know And then we're going to click create job post And we can just go off and create

5:02:48

our job post So it's all pretty simple and easy to do I've shown you how you can log in post jobs You can build this

5:02:53

within a few minutes You sit down for half an hour you can get this deployed and set up And it's really powerful Like

5:02:58

it's pretty amazing This is by far like the best way I've seen to create something to create some sort of big one

5:03:04

thing to note here as well is that we haven't actually paid for this at all So if we go to profile and then we're going

5:03:10

to select our plan We're not on any paid plan here This is completely free so far

5:03:16

They do have premium options but from what I've seen so far I've not been charged which is absolutely wild Now if

5:03:23

you're making UI changes and that sort of thing So for example at this point we're working on task number four which

5:03:29

is adding the job search feature So you can see that you can actually preview different parts of the project So where

5:03:37

it said add job board job card component search we can preview that and have a

5:03:42

look here We can also look at the code that's been updated as well So this is for the job search section So it's easy

5:03:48

to see changes as you go along which is pretty cool You can also change the brand colors So if we say okay change

5:03:54

the projects brand colors to these It's now updating the code across the project

5:04:02

updating the index.css of the project files You've got all these project files as well on the left hand side So you can

5:04:07

see as well you got like the signup page the UI components and you can see that's now been updated with our brand colors

5:04:14

So we added the orange That's looking pretty nice Now the only thing that I would warn you about is the coding and

5:04:19

the changes back and forth They do take a little bit of time so just be prepared for that And then once it's done that

5:04:24

you can just redeploy this So it's asking you to redeploy the app We can click on yes Okay let's go And then we

5:04:30

can go back to our plan Right So in the top left here as well just one thing to note is you've got a plan and you've got

5:04:35

a preview section So preview you can preview what's going on inside the project And then plan you've got the

5:04:41

step-by-step tasks for each section of this project And then once you've done each part you can just click on mark as

5:04:49

done there and just tick it off So that is deploying now We've got that good to go So let's open it up And it's looking

5:04:55

a lot better You can see we got themed orange the CTA buttons orange etc We can sign in as well Let's try that And you

5:05:02

can also see here on the sign up page you can choose between being a job seeker or being an agency So thanks so

5:05:08

much for watching If you want to get the full step-by-step SAP for you or your team so you can go off and create full stack apps with data button And there's

with where you can basically just plug in a message and it will automate a whole workflow for you from step by step

5:06:53

Now I'm going to explain exactly what's going on here how it works But one of the most important parts of this process

5:06:58

is that we actually have a human in the loop method for approving and then

5:07:03

creating the feedback loops inside our AI agent process So let me show you exactly what I mean step by step So

5:07:10

inside here for example you can see we are actually using deepseek and you can use a free API from open router inside

5:07:16

here I'll show you how to set it up in a second and this is on a platform called N Now inside NA10 you can actually build

5:07:23

AI agent workflows So connect to apps So for example this is connected to our Gmail Then we've got different AI agents

5:07:29

like a research agent an introduction agent an agent for rewriting content like you can see right here And step by

5:07:35

step this is going to go off and do its magic for us Right now what you also see inside this section over here is we have

5:07:41

a research agent Each of these agents inside the workflow has different functions So what I'm trying to do in

5:07:48

this workflow and you can apply this to anything that you're trying to automate inside your business I think it's it's really good for you to see the power of

5:07:53

NA10 and how you can set this up but essentially what we're trying to do here is automate the process of creating

5:07:59

video transcripts for our YouTube channels For example inside my YouTube channel here we create avatar videos

5:08:05

with my AI functionality like this This is not me This is an AI And this is 18

5:08:11

minutes long It got 26,000 views So I was like why don't we use that process to create a really nice transcript

5:08:17

inside NA10 and we can basically automate the whole workflow with DeepSeek and one click step by step So

5:08:24

first of all what I'm going to show you is how the workflow runs step by step and how it goes So if we go inside the

5:08:29

chat over here and we say okay here's my video title So I'm going to just put robots right New AI meta robots from

5:08:37

partner And what this is going to do step by step is trigger the workflow So just by typing in and one clicking that

5:08:43

title it's now going to send that over to the research agent And the research agent is basically doing the research on

5:08:50

the internet live to figure out okay what can we talk about in this process Then we've got the introduction agent So

5:08:56

this is going to write the introduction for our video so that we can automate that And now we have a process where the

5:09:03

research agent has given the research to the introduction agent The introduction agent has written it send it over to

5:09:11

this feature right here I'll explain it in a minute And now we can approve the content that's come into the script

5:09:18

before we go any further in the workflow Right And this is great for any sort of workflows where you need like a human

5:09:24

sort of feedback loop to give and improve the content that you create inside your AI agents process So

5:09:32

essentially what this Gmail functionality here is doing is it's asking me to approve the email of the

5:09:37

content we just produced So you can see we get an email to our inbox It says approval required as please approve this

5:09:43

introduction before we carry on And so we've got the introduction for our video And you can see this is actually using

5:09:49

real data to create the content Now this video transcript itself is pretty cool And then if we click on respond here we

5:09:57

can actually give a response on whether this is approved or not And then depending on whether the transcript is

5:10:02

approved If it's approved it will go to the AI agent for creating content And if it's declined then it will go to the

5:10:08

rewriting agent which is then going to feed that back into the feedback loop to improve the process says "If this is

5:10:14

approved great Send it to the next stage If it's not approved let's make sure we improve it with another agent until it

5:10:21

finally is good to go." And the actual content itself is written really nicely using Deep Seek as well So if we look at

5:10:28

this introduction this is better than I could come up with on the spot And you can see here it says "Hey everyone today

5:10:33

I'm going to blow your mind with something that's about to change the game forever Imagine robots working side by side with humans like their best

5:10:38

friends." Sounds crazy right Meta just dropped something called Partner And trust me it's massive This isn't just about robots This is about making them

5:10:44

smarter faster and way more helpful than you ever thought possible Now partner really only got

5:10:49

announced like a few days ago right So this is based on recent data This research process the way that we come up

5:10:55

with the data is we use this model right here open router chat model We use

5:11:00

inplexity sona Now sona is a pretty amazing API where you could build your own

5:11:06

generative search capabilities right and it's using real time research from the internet to figure that out And it's

5:11:13

pretty cheap It's very quick to use and for doing research inside your AI agents this is one of the best things you could

5:11:19

possibly insert So now we can say okay is this approved or not So let me pull up an example right here So you can see

5:11:25

the process in real time right here As you can see this AI agent workflow afterwards is not complete I just want

5:11:31

to show you how powerful this can be as a feedback loop first of all And so if we go to our email for approval from

5:11:37

NA10 if you like it you can say approved And if we hit submit so what that's going to do is approve it and send it to

5:11:44

the next stage of the workflow So it's using a text classifier to figure that out along with deepseek So it's

5:11:50

analyzing the response from us and then it sends it over to this process right here Now if this is declined let me show

5:11:57

you an example So if we go to the chat and we'll run the workflow again and say it's declined And just one thing to note

5:12:03

here is inside our AI agents as well we have these two agents linking directly

5:12:09

to open route over here So if we go back to our emails now now we just need to say okay remove the CTAs from the

5:12:17

content Hit submit and that's going to decline the workflow and send it through to our rewriting agent like you can see

5:12:24

And so we create like a feedback loop where we can reset the whole process based on the feedback we've given the AI

5:12:31

agent so it can rewrite the content and then we're good to go on that It's put it through the rewriting agent The

5:12:36

rewriting agent is on a green tick So that's worked successfully Then it's sent it over to the edit field section

5:12:42

and now we have a new set of content to approve So you can see this has just come through a minute later 10:49 a.m

5:12:50

versus 10:48 a.m And that's the new content to approve So if you ever want to stop the workflow when you're testing

5:12:56

it just click stop And I'll explain exactly how this process works step by step All right the workflow begins when

5:13:02

we set up the new chat message If we delete that we'll hide the chat to trigger this whole workflow you just

5:13:07

click on chat And by the way if you want the whole blueprint from me from today we'll click download on this And inside

5:13:13

the SAP section of the AI profit boardroom I'm going to add a new page called DeepSseek NA10 agents and we'll

5:13:21

upload the blueprint from this agent workflow right there So if you want to just import it and copy and steal it

5:13:27

from me you can inside the AI profit boardroom in the SAP section Additionally this comes with weekly

5:13:33

coaching calls with me So if you have any problems as you go along feel free to ask me on the weekly coaching calls And like I was saying this process we

5:13:41

start with a chat That's how we trigger the message Then inside here we've got the research agent The research agent is

5:13:46

essentially going to go off and research this particular topic All right So if we

5:13:52

put meta AI robots into the chat the research agent will use Plexity's API

5:13:58

using Sona to research that topic That's going to feed into the introduction agent And you can see here that we have

5:14:04

connected the chat model So the API from deepseek R1 distilled llama Now honestly

5:14:10

for writing content I would say deepseat chat 2.5 is good Chat is good as well Whatever you want to use here If you

5:14:16

type in deepseek once you've set up your open router account then you get access to all these other models as well So you

5:14:22

even get Quen Distilled R1 chat is probably the best for writing I also like claw 3.5 Sonic as well And then

5:14:27

inside the introduction agent let me show you the prompts we use here So we've got a system prompt and we have an

5:14:33

user prompt Right So if we click this right here this is going to open up the prompt in full screen so you can see

5:14:39

what we're saying here So we're saying topic see the content from this website Also don't ask me any questions Just

5:14:44

write the content Don't mention title or teaser Just write the script nothing else Do not say title The reason that

5:14:49

we're saying that is because when we're using this process I don't want like any notes I want it to be able to just go

5:14:55

straight into my AI avatar video creator By the way tons of training inside the AI profit boardroom for that as well And

5:15:01

using that process we can easily create the introduction for our transcript Now

5:15:07

we don't want to create the full transcript because we want to make sure the AI agent has written the introduction first and then we can go

5:15:13

step by step into the rest of this process Now the key of this is really having a solid process for the system

5:15:20

message All right so this is user prompt that's dynamic each time and this is a system message that stays the same each

5:15:26

time It's like a custom GPT but it's plugged into the rest of the workflow It's more like an AI agent And you can

5:15:32

imagine here that you've got a team working together right So you got the research agent working alongside the introduction agent And then you have the

5:15:38

rewriting agent that's working with the human feedback I give to the process And

5:15:44

so inside the introduction agent inside the system message we've said you're my

5:15:49

video transcript agent Aim for 15 to 20 minutes per video Use the topic in the

5:15:54

first line which is dynamic each time So that's fed in from the chat So if we say talk about AI robots then this is fed

5:16:02

into the user prompt above Then from here we said create an amazing 4 to6 line teaser for my video etc blah blah

5:16:09

blah Everything else is good to go on that Now that's going to go into a email set module right here Now you might be

5:16:16

wondering okay what is that So this is edit field set and you manually map And this is great when you've got two

5:16:22

different agents feeding into one place cuz what it's going to do is take the previous output from the process All right And then send it to Gmail for

5:16:28

approval So this module right here the Gmail one this is actually a human in

5:16:34

the loop module So if you go to add module inside NA10 And by the way if you're not familiar with all the basics

5:16:39

on NA10 check out my other videos on YouTube about this it'll talk you through step by step how to do it But

5:16:45

essentially you can add like apps agents etc inside Nit link them together And these arrows show you exactly what's

5:16:51

linked together and how So if we go inside the nodes here and we click on human in the loop you can see that we

5:16:56

can approve manually the content we've got so far from the introduction agent Gmail or Google chat Slack or Telegram I

5:17:04

think Telegram would be great but I also think that Telegram has a character limit So that's why I focus on Gmail

5:17:10

instead And now that's going to connect to our text classifier All right So this will send an email to my emails like you

5:17:16

saw earlier in the workflow We can approve or we can say no to that And then inside the text here this basically

5:17:22

sets a filter So if the script is approved it goes to the next part of the workflow If it's declined it goes to the

5:17:27

rewriting agent and that fires it back over to the set field for human approval

5:17:33

Now if we go to the text classifier we've got two different options here So we've got a category for approved which means that we've approved the process

5:17:39

like it looks good to go whatever And then we've also got the option for declined And if we open this up the AI

5:17:45

agent knows this is declined Now this is linked to AI as well So you can see here the model is linked down to open router

5:17:51

using deepsek as well to figure out okay is this declined or is this approved Are we good to go on that and we can send it

5:17:56

over or does it need more improvement And then finally we've got the rewriting agent So the rewriting agent is also

5:18:02

linked to deepseek and it's linked to this module over here You can actually link multiple chat models from the AI

5:18:08

agents to the same AI like you can see And the instructions for this are basically take my feedback which is the

5:18:14

human feedback I give via email improve the script which you can see right here And then you can also get the research

5:18:20

for the script as well down there And then if we open up the prompt for this it's you're an AI powered script improver Your job is to enhance and

5:18:26

provide the script based on human feedback Improve clarity accuracy structure and alignment with the

5:18:32

requested focus whilst maintaining natural readability Boom All right And that's basically the whole process And

5:18:38

it's absolutely mind-blowing Like I only started using this properly I would say about 2 or 3 weeks ago and it felt

5:18:43

really complicated Now it feels like you can build anything that's personalized to you in literally a few hours and it's

5:18:50

a lot of fun as well It's so much fun building out these feedback loops So if you want to get all my best trainings and SPs on you can get that inside the

5:18:58

AI profit boardroom Just type in NM once you join and you'll see all these different workflows right here

5:19:04

Additionally if you want to get the actual template from today just go down to the SAP section and then go to

5:19:10

DeepSeek NA10 agents and you can download the feedback loop method right there Really good for creating content

5:19:16

because obviously content creation if you post it without checking it using AI it could be hallucinated It can have

5:19:21

facts wrong And that's why you need a human in the loop feedback method like this And hopefully it just gets approved

5:19:26

in one click But if not you give it the feedback you can improve it and then review it again once it's done

5:19:32

Additionally if you want to jump on calls with me weekly you'll get that inside the AI profit boardroom along with a community of 124 members like you
